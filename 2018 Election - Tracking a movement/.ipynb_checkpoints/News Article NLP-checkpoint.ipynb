PCEP had a school lockdown days after the Parkland shooting and another lockdown a few weeks later.\\nAnother PCEP student, Raleigh Nolan, spoke at the rally about her experiences in high school. A point of concern for her is the reported six minutes the shooting took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and how the passing time between buildings at PCEP is 10 minutes.\\n“As much as I hate to say it, PCEP is a major tragedy just waiting to happen,” Nolan said during her speech. “Unfortunately, the longer our legislators wait to make a change, the date of this potential tragedy looms closer and closer.”\\nIn the crowd, Nolan’s mom, dad and sister stood in solidarity. Her mom, Angela Nolan, said she is supportive of young people finding and using their voices and participating in policy making.\\n“I don’t sit back. I walk alongside her when she does things like this and I want her to speak up,” Angela Nolan said. “She never asked any opinion on her speech — nothing. I had nothing to do with it. I’m just here to support.”\\n\\n\\n        (function($) {\\n            $(function() {\\n                var data = [\\n                                            {\\n

She said she remembers the Columbine High School massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 12 students and one teacher back when she was high school.\\n“I can only think, what if my friends and I, what if we were brave enough to have started this movement 19 years ago? How many deaths would have been saved?” Hopps said. “I guess we always thought it just seemed so impossible, and right now it seems possible that we can actually make a difference and make this reform happen, finally.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWant more articles like this?

       "   '\\nEmily Towlerton accompanied by three of her children speaks at the Students Demand Action on Gun Reform Rally @thesnews pic.twitter.com/QvnZYtpnSd— Anna Liz Nichols (@annaliznichols) March 14, 2018\\nsrc=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\\n\\nPlymouth High School is a part of a three-school campus called the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park, or PCEP. PCEP had a school lockdown days after the Parkland shooting and another lockdown a few weeks later.\\nAnother PCEP student, Raleigh Nolan, spoke at the rally about her experiences in high school. A point of concern for her is the reported six minutes the shooting took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and how the passing time between buildings at PCEP is 10 minutes.\\n“As much as I hate to say it, PCEP is a major tragedy just waiting to happen,” Nolan said during her speech. “Unfortunately, the longer our legislators wait to make a change, the date of this potential tragedy looms closer and closer.”\\nIn the crowd, Nolan’s mom, dad and sister stood in solidarity. Her mom, Angela Nolan, said she is supportive of young people finding and using their voices and participating in policy making.\\n“I don’t sit back. I walk alongside her when she does things like this and I want her to speak up,” Angela Nolan said. “She never asked any opinion on her speech — nothing. I had nothing to do with it. I’m just here to support.”\\n\\n\\n        (function($) {\\n            $(function() {\\n                var data = [\\n                                            {\\n

       " 'In light of the recent protests against gun violence and other issues, a recent statement from James Cotter, the executive director of admissions and recruitment at MSU, said peaceful protests will not count against prospective and admitted students at MSU.',\n",
       " 'To our future Spartans: pic.twitter.com/I5rZ7FNjDZ',\n",
       " '“Within the context of recent national discussions, ‘peaceful protest,’ a principal on which our nation was built, does not constitute as a threat,” the statement reads. “We treasure the freedom of speech, which is guaranteed by the guiding principles of the U.S. Constitution.”',\n",
       " 'Cotter said in the wake of the Florida school shooting, The National Association for College Admission Counseling has had a great deal of discussion surrounding peaceful protests and how they could affect high school students’ admission or enrollment into a university.',\n",
       " '“We simply wanted to reassure young people that finding their voice is an appropriate right within our country and that it would not negatively impact their admission if they, perhaps, get some sort of discipline for a peaceful protest,” Cotter said.',\n",
       " 'Cotter said there is talk of high school students being involved in peaceful protests and walkouts regarding gun control this month, like the March for Our Lives on March 24.',\n",
       " '“I think students are just making certain that if they’re being involved with those sorts of efforts, that it isn’t going to somehow be negatively interpreted by the college or university that they plan to attend in the future,” Cotter said.',\n",
       " 'More than 100 colleges have expressed the same opinion regarding disciplinary action or suspensions among high school students for being involved in the #NeverAgain protests.',\n",
       " 'For all who want to March with us in DC - Catch us on Pennsylvania Ave. in front of the Capital building at Noon on March 24th! For Sibling Marches in other cities, check here often for updates: https://t.co/HrHYh9rwIE',\n",
       " 'Cotter said students who apply to MSU must answer a series of questions regarding their criminal background.',\n",
       " '“Our application requires a student to report any criminal charges that they may face or suspensions that may have occurred in their previous educational experiences,” Cotter said.',\n",
       " 'When filling out an MSU admission application, students are asked if they have any criminal offense convictions other than traffic violations, including guilty pleas and juvenile court proceedings, and if they have been expelled, suspended, disciplined or placed on probation.',\n",
       " 'Cotter said the MSU Office of Admissions then looks at the responses to the questions and decides whether or not the charges or suspensions pose a threat to the individual or the university community.',\n",
       " 'If a student is admitted and has a change to their criminal record prior to enrollment, they must inform the university of that change.',\n",
       " 'Cotter said MSU Admissions has decided peaceful protests will not pose a threat to the individual or the MSU community.',\n",
       " '“We have received a tremendous amount of feedback from faculty, from deans, from current students and from prospective students in terms of appreciating the fact that we clarified that situation,” Cotter said. “Again, we were getting enough inquires that we felt it important to get that message out.”',\n",
       " 'A Google document that lists all of the responses from different colleges and universities across the nation is being widely circulated.',\n",
       " '\"Never expected this list to be so broadly read and circulated but happy it has been helpful,\" creator Chris Peterson wrote in the document. \"It\\'s been inspiring and exciting to see universities reaffirm the importance of civic engagement in (and through) education.\"',\n",

       "   'White says that gun owners can be dangerous for a multitude of reasons. As well as not being mentally stable or responsible enough for handling a gun on their own, many gun owners do not practice measures to ensure that their firearms are in a safe place inaccessible to others.',\n",
       "   '“Many crimes involving guns aren’t committed by registered gun owners. In a city like Detroit, you have people who have regular access to guns, I mean—there are kids who are 16 and 17 posing with guns in pictures like they’re toys, so that says a lot on its own,” White continued. “Someone has to responsible, these kids need to be protected.”',\n",
       "   'Children do seem to be a big target when it comes to gun violence, and there has been over 300 incidents of gunfire on school grounds in the United States since 2013.',\n",

       "   'White says that “gun laws are tricky. We can enforce laws and hope that they make a difference, but again, the responsibility always falls back on the owner of the gun, and whether or not they know the consequences of using that gun.”',\n",
       "   'Studies show that stricter gun laws do not necessarily mean that less shootings will occur. Gifford’s Law Center graded each state on their gun laws, and some of the lowest ranked states also had some of the lowest death rates by guns.',\n",
       "   'Research also shows that many occurrences of gun violence happen in minority communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, out of 12,979 firearm homicides in 2015, 81 percent of those were committed in minority areas. The data also shows that in Wisconsin, an African American is 26 times more likely to be shot than a white person.',\n",

They weren’t trained to look out for the big bad gun up the block,” he explains.',\n",

That same year, firearms were used in 68 percent of murders, 41 percent of robberies and 21 percent of aggravated assault cases. Most homicide cases nationwide are committed with handguns as well.',\n",

       "   'The bill clarifies that no part of the funding is to go towards arming or training teachers. It was introduced before the Parkland shooting, but gained more attention following it.',\n",

       "   'Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, who represents DeWitt in Michigan’s 24th State Senate District, supports these components.',\n",
       "   '“I have personally been to schools, and walked in, and was shocked at some of the schools that I could just walk right into and no challenge, nothing,” said Jones. “We currently have an anonymous reporting system in Michigan, OK2SAY, and it’s been put in and it’s actually functioning pretty good.”',\n",

Spiegler said if constituents approve, it could prompt stronger bills to be proposed.',\n",

       "   '“It passed the House by a huge margin, and it looks like it has some pretty significant bipartisan support in the Senate, so it’s got a good chance of becoming law,” said Spiegler. “This may have been designed to be able to get through Congress, so it’s been designed to not target guns so Republican members of Congress can sign up for it, they want to do something given how much an issue gun violence has become in the last couple of months since Parkland, so this seems like a good compromise piece of legislation.”',\n",

From healthcare to the elimination of ISIS, both sides discussed why their respective parties are best equipped to deal with the United States' future.</span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There is less than a week until Election Day on Nov. 8. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton currently leads Republican nominee Donald Trump by only two percentage points. A few weeks ago, Clinton had a substantial lead over the GOP nominee that has now diminished. With the race as tight as it is, both UNH College Democrats and Republicans debated each other, the future of their parties and the country in the Memorial Union Building's (MUB) Strafford Room.</span></p><br/><br/><br/>[caption id=\"attachment_7620\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"570\"]<img alt=\"Members of College Republicans (left) and Democrats (right) debate topics based off their personal views and party's platform. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-7620\" height=\"427\" src=\"http://tnhdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/debate-copy-1.jpg\" width=\"570\"/> Members of College Republicans (left) and Democrats (right) debate topics based off their personal views and party's platform.[/caption]<br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The debate started off with each member discussing why they support their party. For the Republicans, it had mostly to do with their respect for hard work and why they think the Republican Party best represents that value. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\"Hard work is very important. A hand up is much better than a hand out,\" College Republicans External Director Scott Myers said.</span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, the College Democrats stressed the ideas of equality, respect and humanity. College Democrats Vice President Douglas Marino stressed the principles of social and economic justice.</span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\"A measure of a successful country is helping its weakest members,\" College Democrats President Elena Ryan said.</span></p><br/><br/><br/>[caption id=\"attachment_7650\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"670\"]<img alt=\"Ricky Aiello (left) and Student Body President Jonathan Dean (right) moderate the debate. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-7650\" height=\"502\" src=\"http://tnhdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14959170_10211590402701531_148047936_o-copy.jpg\" width=\"670\"/> Ricky Aiello (left) and Student Body President Jonathan Dean (right) moderate the debate.[/caption]<br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The first issue on the board was healthcare. The Democrats said that healthcare was not a privilege but a right, while the Republicans said that healthcare is not mentioned as so in the United States Constitution. Both sides acknowledged the problems of ObamaCare, but while the Republicans want healthcare to be a state's issue like RomneyCare, the Democrats said that a single payer system like those in other developed countries such as in Western Europe are a better model, and that improving ObamaCare is a priority. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The next issue was gun control and both sides acknowledged the need for basic background checks. Where the differences began was on the degree to which the government should regulate guns. Marino mentioned legislation that focuses on universal background checks, proper storage, keeping weapons so they are not readily accessible and supporting the no-fly list ban. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Republicans rebutted these arguments by saying that liberals aren't specific enough. While they agreed with universal background checks and keeping those on the no-fly list from buying firearms, they expressed doubt for the efficacy of gun control legislation by pointing out the fact that Chicago has some of the strictest gun control legislation, yet some of the highest crime rates. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ryan's response criticized the National Rifle Association's (NRA) influence over the Republican Party. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The discussion moved to the Black Lives Matter movement and race issues in the country. Both sides acknowledged the validity of Black Lives Matter, but the Republicans disagreed that police officers are racist or that the police institutions are inherently racist. College Republicans Internal Director Nathan Marsolais said that better police training is needed and that where police are missing, crime rises. The Democrats repeatedly said that systematic racism is a core issue that needs to be addressed and that police forces should match their communities.</span></p><br/><br/><br/>[caption id=\"attachment_7651\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"670\"]<img alt=\"he crowd watches the debate in the MUB's Strafford Room.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7651\" height=\"502\" src=\"http://tnhdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/14971062_10211590547105141_1230456038_o-copy.jpg\" width=\"670\"/> he crowd watches the debate in the MUB's Strafford Room.[/caption]<br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">On the topic of immigration, both Democrats and Republicans stressed the importance and value of immigration, but both disagreed on how to go about dealing with the border, citizenship and deportation. The Republicans said they felt that there is a misperception about their party as being anti-immigration. They said that while immigration is important, building a border and removing those who overstay visas is crucial. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Climate change and student debt, two topics that received little attention in the debates between Clinton and Trump, came up in questions from the moderators and students. Wednesday night, there didn't seem to be a unified opinion between the College Democrats and Republics on the whether the science behind climate change is true, but they did agree that finding clean energy solutions would be important for the country's future.</span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Democrats said that climate change is not only real, but also a serious problem. Ryan said that she thinks Clinton is not hard enough on climate change, but said that the Democratic platform is much better in addressing global warming issues. The Democrats and Republicans did agree on one specific policy in relation to climate change and that was giving tax breaks to companies that invest in green energy. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The debate continued with discussions on foreign policy and tax policy. Student debt came up as a core issue of the night as the Democrats embraced Clinton's debt free college policy proposal, while the Republicans were wary of their opponents' embrace of universal education or policies that they think would take away a student's incentive to work hard if college were to be free. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Marino and Ryan as well as Marsolias and his fellow College Republicans member Elizabeth Girard spoke to TNH after the debate. They all agreed that the event was very productive, and that both groups share some </span><span class=\"s2\">things in common. </span></p><br/><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">\"I thought it was very important for students to see where we agree. Obviously we have significant areas of disagreement, but we do have areas of overlap where we can work together. So I think that was another thing that was valuable for people to see, that we didn't necessarily see in the presidential debates,\" Marino said. </span></p></div>\n",
