0,"A primer for Indiana students organizing or participating in March For Our Lives on March 24:Don’t let anyone tell you that it isn’t the laws that are the problem and that AR-15-style weapons are protected by the Second Amendment. Six states and the District of Columbia have banned these weapons. The Supreme Court recently rejected a challenge to a ban on weapons, leaving in place the lower court’s decision that such a ban is permissible under the Second Amendment.Laws that provide legal access to firearms by individuals under age 21 increase the risk of school shootings. Most school shootings involve a student at the school or a former student.Federal law only requires a background check by a federally licensed firearm dealer. An individual who has been declined can purchase the firearm from a private seller at a gun show in Indiana. Private sellers in Indiana legally sell all types of firearms, including AR-15s, to individuals age 18 and over without a background check. Studies show that states with the weakest gun laws have the highest rate of gun deaths.— Ed Smith, president of the Hoosiers Concerned About Gun Violence nonprofit organization",N/A,"

2,"Last night a farmer, a carpenter, a machinist, and a veteran faced off in a Democratic debate at Purdue University that was hosted by the Purdue College Democrats. The candidates are running for the democratic party in Indiana's 4th Congressional District which Tippecanoe county is a part of. The candidates each got to answer a variety of questions pertaining to both hot topic issues and those that affect this district.The debate started with each candidate giving their opening statements, followed by a lightning round of questions, and ending on longer response questions and closing statements. The candidates all seemed to agree on most of the issues brought up in the debate, such as, wanting universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage, enacting common sense gun laws, and working to get high speed internet in the rural areas that need them. At the end of the event the candidates stayed after to talk and answer questions from members of the community. For details on the debate and how each of the candidates answered the questions stay tuned for Thursday's edition of the paper. ",N/A,"

3,"The only schools in Montana with a gun-carrying educator are small and remote. But recent school shootings have larger and less-isolated schools looking at putting a gun in their buildings. Elder Grove and Shepherd schools are exploring policies to implement a Montana law that allows trustees to arm anyone — a teacher, administrator, or community member.The two districts, while still considered small and rural in a national scope, have much larger enrollments that other Montana schools that have armed staffers. And while the districts are in rural areas, they're both within 15 minutes of Billings.“I guess the board feels it's important,"" said Elder Grove superintendent Justin Klebe. ""I just have some teachers, I think all of us in some ways, looking at how to keep kids safe.”School shootings in Parkland, Florida, and Santa Fe, Texas, placed a magnifying glass on student safety, and the idea of arming teachers — which long circulated on the fringes of mainstream education policy — received a major boost from President Donald Trump. Montana's senators and congressman cautious on arming teachers as Trump pushes ideaOthers have pushed back; the lion's share of testimony at a recent meeting of a federal school safety panel advocated for providing more mental health resources and reforming school discipline practices — and not arming teachers. Several national organizations that represent schools, teachers and administrators have opposed arming teachers. Virtually no academic research provides evidence that arming teachers stops or prevents shootings, but a national study of mass shootings highlighted how response times from police are often too late to prevent carnage. Montana, a state with strong general support for firearms, has a law that for years has allowed schools to choose to put a gun on campus. But very few schools have armed a staffer; a Gazette review of public records from every school district in the state last spring showed that only Lima, Belfry and Custer have an armed staffer. A handful of other schools approved a staffer to carry a weapon, but that staffer declined. While Montana school boards can put guns in schools, very few choose to arm educatorsThat data could have changed in the year since the analysis was conducted, and discussions at Shepherd and Elder Grove could indicate increased interest in the topic among schools. Last week Shepherd trustees unanimously passed the first reading of a policy that lays out framework for a staffer who wants to carry a weapon. It doesn't authorize a specific person to carry a weapon, and future approval would be public. Educators would volunteer to carry a weapon; they wouldn't be allowed to store it on school grounds. “We’d rather be proactive than reactive,” said Shepherd superintendent Scott Carter.Both Shepherd and Elder Grove have borrowed heavily from the method Custer schools took to arming a staffer. For several months in 2013 and 2014, a Custer safety committee made up of law enforcement, trustees and educators examined types of weapons, bullets, training, background checks and police coordination. A pair of public meetings were held discussing the proposal, and letters were mailed out to district parents. Trustees unanimously approved a proposal requiring a psychological review, firearms training and background checks to carry in school.Shepherd's policy also follows a Custer policy that keeps the name of armed staffers private. The Gazette maintains the information is public under the statute that allows school boards to put guns in school, but has not formally challenged the policy, nor identified armed staffers in districts that did provide the name as part of the public record. Elder Grove has yet to introduce any sort of formal proposal, and Klebe emphasized talks are in early stages. The district conducted a parent survey, but Klebe said only about 50 out of 300 households responded. He said trustees had specifically expressed concerns about police response times; just West of Billings, Klebe estimated it could take about 10 minutes for an officer to reach the school in an emergency. “If we do go down that road, we’d have a committee that would come up with the procedures and expectations of everybody,” he said. “It wouldn’t be just arming teachers and anyone could carry.”Part of the reason for interest at Elder Grove, Kelbe said, was the recent removal of a school resource officer. Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder confirmed that a shared school officer was put back on regular duty in 2016. The officer had also worked with other schools surrounding Billings. The Sheriff's Department still has two SROs, one who splits time between Shepherd and Custer and one who splits time between Lockwood and Huntley Project.“We needed the deputy back on the streets,” Linder said. ""That one made the most sense.""Carter said he's glad Shepherd has an SRO, but between duties at Custer, training and travel time, there are gaps. “At times there’s no one available,” he said.Carter, too, brought up response times as a concern. Billings Public Schools, a system that dwarfs other schools in the county, had seven SROs on staff this school year. In March, the district announced plans to hire another SRO to float between elementary schools. Billings schools pay for up-front costs like a vehicle and weapons for an officer who is supplied by the Billings Police Department, and the district pays the officer's salary and benefits. Linder said the sheriff's department isn't reimbursed for its SROs. “All the schools want SROs,"" Linder said. ""We just don’t have the manpower for it.”Montana has no statewide accounting of school resource officers, but small districts typically struggle to fund such a position. Elder Grove also doesn't have the money to pick up costs like salary, Klebe said. “That would be an increase to the budget, anywhere from $40,000 to $60,000,” he said. “We don’t have that left over in the budget.”Having nearby police isn't a guarantee schools won't look at arming educators. School trustees in Cody, Wyoming, operating under a new law that's more broad than Montana's, voted to allow educators with a concealed carry permit and who undergo additional training to carry guns in schools in April. The town of nearly 10,000 has its own police force, including a school resource officer who is assigned to five different schools. Among trustees' rational for arming teachers? Response times.Craig McKinney, a middle school teacher who leads Shepherd's local union, spoke against the policy at the June 13 meeting. School safety goes far beyond arming educators“I don’t disagree with the fact that basically we’re a rural school ... with response times out there, it would be too late,” he said in a later interview. “I understand where the board’s coming from. I just don’t think adding more firepower to schools is the answer.”McKinney said that's his personal view as a teacher and someone who's ""just not a gun person,"" not a union stance. “We have teachers that are for it, we have teachers that are against it,” he said. He had concerns about a specific provision in the policy that reads, ""in the event of an active shooter, the authorized staff will actively engage the shooter.""“What if the teacher doesn’t engage,"" or does shoot and hits someone else, McKinney said.He also was worried allowing one or more staffers to carry a gun would provide a false sense of security. “There’s no guarantees. I think it just makes people maybe feel safer,” he said. “I believe that there would be people that don’t feel any safer because now you’ve added more guns into the school.”He cited Shepherd's sprawling campus layout and multiple entry points as problematic, even with armed staffers. He said infrastructure improvements would be a better way to focus on security. Shepherd's policy doesn't refute that point. It lists the following among ""Factors and Rationale For The Armed Staff Program:""""Our facilities themselves are not up to standards when it comes to state of the art security measures, and bringing them up to that standard can be cost prohibitive.""Montana is applying for money from a new school safety grant program that would bolster mental health training for teachers and support programs already in schools, but there's no guarantee the state gets money out of a highly competitive application process. Another round of grants from the same program could provide money for safety-related infrastructure improvements, but it's unclear if the state will apply, and competition would still be steep.School funding for infrastructure or safety at the state level has been a tough sell. Schools can impose an automatic levy on local taxpayers to raise some money for infrastructure improvements, and a proposal that could make its way to next spring's legislature would clarify that such money can be used for safety upgrades. But having to choose between fixing a heat pump and building an entrance vestibule to control visitor access isn't a good choice, Carter said. ""We can use all of that money just maintaining our buildings,"" he said. ""The pot gets real small real quick.""Carter also said Shepherd works to provide mental health support to students. However, cuts in state aid to organizations that often are contracted to work in schools resulted in fewer specialized staff in schools across the state. Retiring Billings Superintendent Terry Bouck, who has advocated for adding SROs over arming educators, emphasized the importance of such programs in a newsletter emailed to subscribers districtwide after the Santa Fe shooting that called for governments to ""restore and continue mental health funding for our schools and communities.""In the same newsletter, Bouck called for increased infrastructure funding to address security needs. One topic that history says legislators will address in next spring's session? A gun-related school bill.In each of Montana's past four legislative sessions, there’s been a bill addressing the presence of guns in schools, ranging from opening up carry to anyone with a concealed permit to easing student penalties for having fake guns on school grounds.In 2017, a bill from Rep. Seth Berglee, a Joliet Republican, would have allowed school employees who meet certain requirements to carry concealed weapons on school property.Enrollment keeps rising in this Billings K-8 school district — much faster than expectedAmid that climate, Klebe hoped that legislators wouldn't loose sight of overall school funding. A budget crunch last cycle resulted in a variety of school funding cuts, including a move that forced local property taxpayers to pick up a bill for their schools worth $40 million over two years. Elder Grove already has a low percentage of voted local levies. State law requires schools to meet a minimum budget, which includes automatic local taxes. But voted taxes can bump budgets up about 20 percent. Elder Grove did recently pass a $14.9 million bond in December for a major building project. “It’s increasingly becoming harder for us to keep up with the area schools due to our budget constraints, then you put this on top of it,” Klebe said. “As far as trying to scratch out $40,000 to $60,000 for a resource officer, when we are already spending as conservatively as we can, it's an impossible feat.”",N/A,"

4,"A farm-owner, a carpenter, a machinist and a veteran faced off in a Democratic debate last week at Purdue hosted by the Purdue College Democrats.The candidates, who are running for Democratic Party representative in Indiana’s 4th congressional district, answered a variety of questions pertaining to hot-topic issues and those that affect the district. While many of their views were aligned with one another, it also served as a good opportunity for members of the community to share their concerns.The debate started off with opening statements from each candidate:Tobi Beck, a veteran who served in the 571st Military Police, talked about the need for cleaner energy and a universal health care plan and stressed the importance of getting out to vote.Joe Mackey, a retired machinist, spoke of the current pediatric children’s cancer foundation he runs and his passion for health care fueled by the loss of two of his three children to cancer. He elaborated on his problem with health care, bringing up the issue of predatory insurance policies and lack of coverage for pre-existing conditions.Veronikka Ziol, a carpenter and DIY-er who stated she’s running for “the little guy” — the people of the working class — and wants to give them a voice. She wants to end trickle-down economics and get the money out of the wealthy elite, instead giving it to the working class. She ended with her slogan: Clean, Fix, Build.Darin Griesey, a Purdue alumnus and farm-owner, went into his backstory of running his own nonprofit in Los Angeles, which focuses on human rights issues and environmental conservation. He said he returned to Indiana as a lobbyist before taking a job in Indianapolis to help low-income neighborhoods. He reflected on his campaign and the tour he had taken around the district to learn about issues from the community.After the statements, the candidates were asked a series of questions focusing on national and local issues that affect the community.Health careSupport for a universal health care plan was echoed from all candidates. Everyone was in strong favor of covering pre-existing conditions and expanding the Affordable Care Act to do so. Beck and Griesey expressed the need for listening when it comes to building health care plans.“That’s what we need in a representative, somebody that will talk to us, that will show up and then go represent us in Congress,” Beck said.The last question, on abortion, showed all candidates as pro-choice.“I’m still surprised we’re even talking about this,” Griesey said.Job wages / tax reformAs with health care, the candidates were practically unanimous with their answers on job wages, tax reforms and workers unions.All of the candidates were in favor of a new progressive tax system, with Ziol and Beck wanting to tax uninvested money by corporations as well.The candidates remained progressive when discussing minimum wage.Beck was first to answer by discussing the success Washington has had since it has increased to a $15-per-hour minimum wage. As was the trend for the debate, all of the candidates echoed their support for this, with Ziol mentioning a minimum wage as high as $22 per hour.“If minimum wage kept up with inflation, we would already be at $15 an hour,” Ziol said. “If it had kept up with worker productivity, we would be over $22 an hour; I think $15 an hour is at least something that even Republicans should be able to agree on.”Lastly, on workers unions, each candidate briefly showed support for allowing workers to come together and voice their opinions. Mackey shared that he was the only candidate endorsed by the unions.“Democrats cannot just say they support unions,” Mackey said. “Democrats have grown far too comfortable sitting in boardrooms and not going to union halls. I go to the union halls, I speak to union membership. They’re supporting my campaign; I hope you will, as well.”Gun controlIt was this topic where there was a variety of answers; while all were for gun control, each had different ideas for action.Ziol wants to ban the popular AR-15, the gun used in the Parkland school shooting last month, and have stricter licensing when purchasing a gun. Griesey brought up raising the purchase age to 21, ending the gun-show loophole and requiring additional testing when obtaining a concealed-carry permit. Beck called for lifting the restriction on research imposed on the CDC. Mackey came out strong for gun control and went on to discuss his work and support for Moms Demand Action, a national group in support of common-sense gun laws.Marijuana legalization“I think it’s time to end the drug war on marijuana,” Mackey said.The conversation over medical marijuana legalization was rather short but united. Mackey was also in favor of reclassifying it from a Schedule I classification.Beck focused on the opioid crisis, bringing up that states that have legalized medical marijuana have a smaller opioid problem.Ziol was in favor of legalizing marijuana for medicinal and recreational purposes.Griesey, being last to answer, reiterated the previous answers and brought up his history in fighting for decriminalization:“Well out of all of us that are here, I’ve been in front of this issue for 25 years. I’ve drafted up legislation to decriminalize marijuana in Indiana 25 years ago and opened it up to the industrial hemp market as well.”InfrastructureAll of the candidates were for bringing high-speed internet to the rural areas and schools of Indiana.Beck also supported improving the condition of roads and increasing the repair of potholes.Ziol went further and talked about the degradation of bridges and the need to fix them.Griesey emphasized the need for clean water on top of expressing support for high-speed internet.The last question, on the idea of more toll roads in Indiana, was met with a resounding “No” from all of the candidates.",N/A,"

5,"Following the trend of universities like Notre Dame and Indiana University, Purdue tweeted on Feb. 26 a clarification that any students who choose to participate in “a peaceful protest on any side of any subject or (engage) in any other form of protected speech” would not be punished for their nonviolent actions.The tweet came out 12 days after the Parkland, Florida, shooting, which sparked a movement led by the survivors to reform gun legislation.Purdue and other universities have made a point to reassure current and future students that peacefully challenging the status quo won’t lead to disciplinary action down the road. This shows a certain level of wisdom and delicacy that should be adopted by more universities.A comprehensive list of those universities that have made a statement protecting civil protesters can be found at the website “Never Again Colleges,” referencing the pro-gun control movement “#NeverAgain.”These comforting statements should serve as a sign to our current presidential administration that the students who suffer through tragedies like the Parkland shooting will not be bullied or scared into silence and submission. Without the worry of having their college acceptances rescinded or being punished, students will be able to exercise their freedom of speech to protest laws they disagree with.Other universities should take note and make a point to encourage their prospective and current students to “speak, write, listen, challenge and learn,” as Purdue tells its students.As past, present and future students are granted the ability to act peacefully for what they believe in, real legislative change will be able to take place.",N/A,"

6,"Nationally, the average response time of police is 10 minutes.In an active shooter situation — like the one seen at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, just a few weeks ago — each second it takes for first responders to arrive on scene can mean life or death for victims.A controversial plan to limit the loss of life in such an instance was given fuel recently when President Donald Trump endorsed it, igniting a national debate on its validity. The proposal suggests teachers and school administrators — who are willing to do so — arm themselves to provide yet another option of last resort if confronted with a shooter.The proposal has drawn criticism from teachers and gun control advocates alike; however, a Purdue professor and homeland security expert has conducted research that supports the plan’s premise.Professor Eric Dietz, previously the executive director for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, conducted research in 2014 that found having either an armed guard or armed staff on school grounds can reduce the number of casualties in a mass shooting situation by up to 70 percent by, at the very least, slowing an attacker.“Time is your ally,” he said.In an ideal scenario, Dietz said, a campus would have multiple school resource officers, who are usually trained police officers, on or near the school grounds. MSDS in Parkland had such a safety measure in place, but that officer failed to enter the building after being made aware of the shooting for reasons that are still unclear.Both the Lafayette and West Lafayette Police Departments have trained school resource officers on staff.After tragedies like the one at MSDS or Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, advocates on both side of the gun debate come out in force.“There’s a mass of people that come out and say no guns,” Dietz said. “Then you have the people that favor guns coming out and saying, ‘Well it’s not the guns. … It’s the one person who was disturbed that did the killing.’”Many of the arguments, both for and against the proposal to arm teachers, are grounded in emotion. Dietz’s research, on the other hand, approaches the topic from an engineering perspective.“What we were trying to do is offer some insight to the trade-offs and value judgements to treat the school safety problem,” he said.If trained resource officers are not available because of budgetary constraints or other considerations, armed teachers or administrators can have a similar effect, according to Dietz’s research. Having as few as 5 to 10 percent of a school’s staff armed with a firearm could reduce casualties by 5 to 20 percent, his research showed.Professor Janet Alsup, head of the College of Education’s department of curriculum and instruction has reservations about the proposal.“I think it’s very problematic,” she said in an email. “Teachers are educated to be experts in pedagogy, learning sciences, and their content areas, not in armed combat. If we begin to require (or even strongly suggest) that teachers in k-12 classrooms should be willing and able to engage in armed confrontations with school shooters, this puts an undue burden on individual teachers — and on the profession at large.”Before coming to Purdue, Alsup spent time as a middle and high school teacher. Even if she was given the opportunity as a teacher, she said she would not have considered carrying a firearm.“I think it would have undermined my role and impact considerably,” she said. “It would have changed both how I thought about my job as teacher and how I understood others’ expectations of me.”Dietz said that he would never suggest someone who has any apprehension about carrying a weapon to do so. In fact, he said those are the last people he would like to see carrying a firearm.The Indiana State Teachers Association released a statement that called on legislators to provide more resources to aid students struggling with trauma rather than bring weapons into a learning environment.“Arming educators sends a signal that we are giving up and accepting this crisis as the new reality,” the statement read. “Instead of arming educators with guns, lawmakers should start by arming our schools with more psychologists and counselors so kids dealing with trauma get care before they become broken. Educators need to be focused on teaching our students. Together — parents, educators, lawmakers, community leaders — need to come up with real solutions that really will save lives.”No matter which side of the debate one falls on, the goal is the same: save lives.“Every life is precious,” Dietz said.But Dietz urged legislators to use evidence-based reasoning when deciding how best to address the pressing issue.“After these big events, we want to do things that have been shown to have a deliberate impact on reducing casualties, not something we hope, suspect or have faith will reduce casualties.”",N/A,"

And when we answer yes, they'll ask us what we did about it. What we said. Where we stood. We can't change this administration's policy but we can help defend the victims of it.

8,"Stakes were high and rebuttals were heated at Tuesday night’s Tippecanoe County sheriff and prosecutor primary debate.The debate, hosted by WLFI, was held at the Faith West Community Center, where the sheriff candidates took the stage first.SheriffThe three running are incumbent Barry Richard, who has held the position since 2014; Lt. John “Woody” Ricks; and current West Lafayette Police Chief Jason Dombkowski.Dombkowski spent his opening remarks and much of the debate criticizing Richard’s lack of presence around the office.“I’m running to restore leadership to the office of sheriff,” he said. “You can’t be a leader if you’re not present. The current sheriff is a no-show.”Richard did not respond to these pointed accusations, and instead spent his opening remarks highlighting some of the projects and achievements he has accomplished over the past four years.“We have replaced our vehicles with all-wheel and four-wheel drive SUVs and trucks, providing a safer and more effective situation for our deputies and staff,” he said. “A training initiative with policemen has been obtained for our department’s continued development.”While the back-and-forth between Richard and Dombkowski became more heated throughout the debate, Ricks stood out of the crossfire and stuck with his opening message.“Leadership starts at the top,” he said. “Tippecanoe County is a great community. We need to strive to keep it a great place to live, work and raise a family.”The dispute between candidates intensified during the Q&A section of the debate, especially during inquiries about the Tippecanoe County needle exchange program and current gun control laws.Richard would rather see the Gateway to Hope needle exchange program take a different direction.“I would like to see a lot more counseling and programs within the program,” he said.Conversely, Ricks and Dombkowski are not advocates of the needle exchange program; they both feel it should be removed in favor of alternatives that focus on preventive measures.“I would advocate treatment, jail-based treatment, and get people the help that they need and stop the band-aid effect of a needle exchange program,” Dombkowski said.“I think that we have to go to the root of the problem,” Ricks said. “We have to get these people the kind of help that they need, and enabling them with these needles is not going to help the situation.”Regarding current gun laws, all candidates are in strong support of the Second Amendment, but have differing views on which components of the law need to be reinforced.Ricks said he advocates stronger gun laws across the board and harsher penalties for people carrying unlicensed firearms.Dombkowski vehemently defended the right to bear arms, but did admit that he supports stronger policy in some aspects of gun law.“I support stricter background checks,” Dombkowski. “And it’s about access, stricter background checks. It’s not about the weapons themselves.”Richard, however, seemed to strongly disagree with Dombkowski’s view of the innocence of weapons.“Eliminate assault rifles — they mean just that — assault; eliminate high capacity magazines; eliminate bump stocks which turn semi-automatic into an automatic weapon,” Richard said.ProsecutorThe second half of the debate was reserved for the candidates for Tippecanoe County prosecutor: incumbent Patrick Harrington and local defense attorney Earl McCoy.McCoy wasted no time in his opening remarks, criticizing Harrington’s commitment to the county prosecutor position, as well as his methods.“When a major case comes along, our elected prosecutor shouldn’t be MIA;” McCoy said. “He should be in the courtroom trying those cases ... Thousands of cases each year are going unfiled. Thousands of criminals are walking our streets and being unpunished because cases haven’t been filed.”Harrington’s opening statement did not respond to these pointed accusations, but instead focused on the achievements of the prosecutor’s office while under his administration.“I am proud of our success over my tenure as your prosecutor,” Harrington said. “A record is one based upon accomplishments and achievements. We’ve won 21 out of 23 murder cases. We convict nine out of 10 major felons in jury trials. That’s an increase of one-third from the prior administration.”When asked how he would use his role as prosecutor to help solve the opioid crisis in Tippecanoe County, Harrington said he has already been an active member in helping find solutions.“I’ve worked very hard for the last several years in the opiate crisis,” Harrington said. “I’ve reached out to our state legislatures and they’ve passed laws this year, in fact, that restrict the number of opiate prescriptions that doctors can write.”McCoy believes Harrington is taking his role in state legislature too far to the point where he may even be neglecting his duties as Tippecanoe County prosecutor.“If you want to be a legislator, you should run for the office,” McCoy said.Voters have the option to mail in their ballots, or cast their votes at several voting centers located around the county on May 8.",N/A,"

9,"Ever felt particularly hungry after a Wendy’s commercial? Felt better about yourself after buying ""natural"" products wrapped in green and beige plastic? Been enticed to buy cool sunglasses after seeing your favorite celebrity sport them in the latest action movie?These are all examples of “nudging,” an advertising strategy mentioned by Purdue President Mitch Daniels in his recent Washington Post column, “Someone is watching you.”Nudging works by using strategies such as emotional advertising, subtle hints, differently colored packaging and more expensive default settings to prod consumers to spend more money, according to an article written in the Harvard Business Review. These nudges are supposed to influence customers’ moods and desires to buy more products without having them realize that they’re being swayed.Critics of nudging complain that these psychological advertisements relieve people of their personal autonomy and keep people from making well-informed decisions. Some may posit that nudging is akin to deceiving and lying to customers, thus breaking a fundamental promise of honesty and trust between business and consumer. Much of the data employed by “nudgers” is used to send user-specific ads, such as keeping track of past purchases to suggest new deals for Amazon Prime subscribers.In truth, the worry that our data is being used against us is ridiculous. Complaints against nudging that suggest that personal autonomy does not exist should be regarded as baseless, and they simply aren’t true: Everyone has the capacity to make their own decisions. A company that sends you ads based off of your search history isn’t forcing you to purchase anything. Nudging is nothing more than a well-thought-out advertising strategy, not an evil to subvert free will, and it should stop being treated as such.On a more pragmatic note, if your data is being used to provide you with deals specific to your interests or on items you purchase regularly, where exactly is the problem?That aside, advertisers aren’t trying to explicitly lie to customers.The only “unfair” advantages that marketing departments have are the countless years spent researching their audience market — no brainwashing ray guns or magical spells force consumers to buy their products. While advertisers may have a slight upper hand due to years of research, consumers hold the ultimate moral responsibility for what they purchase.If an “all-natural” tagline or well-shot commercial actually makes you purchase something, there’s a higher chance that you have a problem with self-control, not that some advertiser is controlling you from a far-away cubicle.",N/A,"

10,"Purdue’s Spring 2018 Presidential Lectures series, hosted by Mitch Daniels, kicked off Monday night with former US senator Bob Kerrey.Kerrey, a pharmacy graduate, discussed his life, opinions and experiences and engaged in active conversation with both Daniels and the audience.“You were a bit of a maverick in your time, we don’t see much of that these days,” Daniels pointed out.Kerrey's argument was that modern day politicians found themselves sticking to the orthodoxy of their political party. However, he repeatedly noted the hope he had for the youth in politics.“People my age encourage the youth to become cynics,” he said before encouraging young people in politics to keep a positive outlook.At the same time, the former senator made a point to argue that young people did not need to delve too far into politics, a thought shared by Daniels.“Love of country is not related to the absorption of politics,” Daniels added to Kerrey’s comments.When a young high school junior in the audience stood up and asked about gun control regulations, Kerrey said, “Young people should not be asking these kinds of questions because they’re afraid to go to school.”Having been the president of higher education institutions himself, Kerrey also felt strongly about issues like student debt. He addressed such matters by making Purdue University a positive example for what universities should be doing to reduce tuitions. These included things like implementing the tuition freeze and encouraging all students to complete their higher education.Kerrey also told the audience a bit about his experience with opioids. While serving in the US military during the Vietnam War, Kerrey had sustained injuries that required opioid treatment.“I can still taste them in my mouth,” he said, expressing sympathy for those currently going through addiction problems.The lecture concluded with a series of questions from the audience, ranging a variety of different topics that allowed the audience to interact and exchange ideas with the featured guest.",N/A,"

11,"INDIANAPOLIS — Gov. Eric Holcomb is working with state agency leaders to develop both short- and long-term recommendations for improving school safety in Indiana following the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 students and teachers.The Republican said he met for two hours last week with every state official who has ""anything remotely to do with school safety"" to ascertain if Indiana is doing everything it can to prevent a similar incident from happening at a Hoosier school and whether the state is prepared to respond should the worst occur.He said the group agreed the best way to control what happens inside school buildings is to control who is permitted to enter the facilities.""How do we assure parents and students and teachers that only the right people are inside?"" Holcomb asked. ""That's first, taking care of that perimeter.""Once we get past that layer, then we have to make sure all of the coordination is occurring between local law enforcement and those schools.""The governor said he intends to issue recommendations for immediate action by mid-March, so members of the Indiana General Assembly can take them home to their constituents following the conclusion of the annual legislative session.""I just don't want folks in this building (the Statehouse) knowing what's going on, I want folks knowing what's going on in all 92 counties and the smallest towns out there,"" Holcomb said.Later in the year, he plans to announce long-term school safety improvements that he'll ask lawmakers to consider in the 2019 session as they craft the next two-year state budget.""If there needs to be improvement, then we're prepared to make sure that we're doing everything humanly possible to protect our students when they go to school,"" Holcomb said.Indiana already offers school safety training to educators and other school personnel, provides $10 million a year in school safety grants, permits armed school resource officers to roam building hallways and has a ""red flag"" law allowing guns to be taken from individuals deemed dangerous by a court.""What I've realized over the last week is actually Indiana is a leader on this front in many ways,"" Holcomb said. ""We've had states calling us saying, 'How did you do this or how did you do that?'""Nevertheless, Holcomb insisted there always is more that can be done because the consequences of not doing enough would be devastating.",N/A,"

12,"The Indiana Supreme Court has agreed to weigh in on an insurance company's legal efforts not to pay out to the parents of 19-year-old murder victim Amanda Bach.The high court will decide whether the intentional and illegal actions by convicted murderer Dustin McCowan absolve the homeowner's insurance policy from paying out not only for him, but on his father as well under state law, according to a court document from the underlying federal case.American Family Mutual Insurance Company succeeded in dodging a claim involving McCowan by citing a clause in the family's homeowner policy that excludes liability when an action is intentional and/or in violation of the law, according the federal courts.But the federal court did not grant the insurance company the same exclusion for McCowan's father, Joseph McCowan.Joseph McCowan, a Crown Point police officer, is targeted by Bach's parents for negligently failing to secure his firearm, which was accessible to his son and is believed to have been used by him to shoot Amanda Bach on Sept. 16, 2011.The Indiana Supreme Court can be questioned about legal issues that arise in federal cases when the questions are determinative of the case and yet there is no ""clear controlling Indiana precedent,"" according to the federal court documents.The Indiana Supreme Court agreed this week to take up the issue and both sides have until June 15 to file written arguments. Oral arguments will be heard by the court June 28.William and Sandra Bach, parents of Amanda Bach, are seeking an unspecified amount of money in the suit, which targets Dustin McCowan's intentional acts under the Indiana Child Wrongful Death statute.The civil suit further accuses Joseph McCowan of contributing to the murder by not properly securing his firearms.Dustin McCowan was sentenced in March 2013 to 60 years in prison for murdering the Portage resident, who was a former girlfriend.A jury heard evidence for nearly a month before finding him guilty of shooting Bach in the throat during the early morning hours after she showed up at the Union Township home where McCowan was living. Bach's partially clothed body was found the following day less than 300 yards from the house in a wooded area along County Road 625 West at the Canadian National Railroad tracks.",N/A,"

13,"Barbara Pierce Bush, who helped propel her husband and their son to the presidency and became by virtue of her wit, self-deprecation and work on literacy one of the most popular first ladies in U.S. history, has died, according to a family spokesman.Bush, who suffered from heart and respiratory problems, was 92.On Sunday, the office of her husband of 73 years, President George H.W. Bush, said that following a series of hospitalizations, she had “decided not to seek additional medical treatment and will instead focus on comfort care.”“It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself — thanks to her abiding faith — but for others,” the statement said. “She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and, especially, the prayers she is receiving.”The announcement led to an outpouring of praise from the public and high-ranking officials from across the political spectrum.Bush is the second woman in U.S. history to have been the wife of one president and the mother of another. But Barbara Bush, unlike Abigail Adams, the wife of second U.S. President John Adams and mother of sixth U.S. President John Quincy Adams, lived to see her son George W. Bush inhabit the White House for two terms. She also campaigned on behalf of another son, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, during his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.While she was unpretentious, plainspoken and down-to-earth, Bush was also a Northeastern blueblood who was strong-willed, politically shrewd, always blunt and occasionally caustic.She often downplayed her own considerable skills by saying: “All I ever did was marry and birth well.”As first lady from 1989 to 1993, she sometimes had a popularity rating that was higher than her husband’s. His presidency may have been imperfect — judged successful in foreign affairs and disappointing on the domestic economic front — but the first lady wielded a behind-the-scenes influence and the skills of an effective campaigner.Part of her strength was her willingness to poke fun, particularly at herself. Her signature fashion statement was a three-strand choker of unmistakably fake pearls. Her prematurely white hair earned her a teasing family nickname, “the Silver Fox,” even as it inspired unkind gibes about looking like her husband’s mother. (He was born one year before her.)Frequent photographs of her reading to AIDS babies or underprivileged schoolchildren served to soften a toughness that she acknowledged had come to her late in life, after giving birth to six children, five of whom survive her. To her children and the White House staff, she was “the enforcer” who spoke volumes with a simple raised eyebrow.During her first year in the White House, she was criticized by Liz Carpenter, former press secretary of another first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, for refusing to speak out on issues that were important to women.In her 1994 memoir, Bush published a response that she wrote but never mailed: “Long ago I decided in life I had to have priorities. I put my children and husband at the top of my list. That’s a choice that I never regretted.” Abortion rights, the Equal Rights Amendment and gun control were not priorities for her, she wrote. “I leave that for those courageous enough to run for public office.”Because the two wives who preceded her in the White House — Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan — were frequently accused of wielding too much political influence, the public may have been ready for Bush’s deference to her husband in policy matters.The nonpartisan social causes she worked for — literacy and volunteerism — stemmed from the tradition of noblesse oblige that was part of her moneyed heritage. Her dedication to philanthropic work was also rooted in personal tragedy.When her second child, a girl nicknamed Robin, died of leukemia at age 3 in 1953, Bush turned to volunteering as a way to cope with the loss. Literacy also held personal significance because Bush had helped her son Neil overcome dyslexia.Bush admitted that she shaped her public image to avoid controversy, but occasionally a wicked, sarcastic side broke through.Her most widely reported gaffe occurred in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan’s re-election campaign, when reporters chided her about her husband’s wealth. She responded by calling Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro “that $4-million — I can’t say it, but it rhymes with rich.” Bush said she thought the comments were off the record; she immediately apologized.In 2005, when her son’s administration was under fire for its slow response to Hurricane Katrina, she seemed to suggest a silver lining for its victims after touring the Houston Astrodome, which was used as a relocation center for New Orleans residents. “Many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this is working very well for them,” she said. The administration defended the remark as a “personal observation” based on her conversations with people who were grateful for the help Texas gave them.When she was first lady, her son George said he considered her “a genius with the media” because she easily joked with reporters, according to a biography by the National First Ladies’ Library. He repeatedly called on his mother for advice while campaigning for and serving in the White House.Comments about their relationship were a staple of their political speeches, and she often reminded supporters about her son’s headstrong behavior, evident from childhood.His tenaciousness was “what you want in a president; it’s not what you want in a 6-year-old,” Barbara said during a 2005 appearance with him in Florida.“Mothers are allowed to be proud of their sons,” she told CNN anchor Larry King in 2003.Barbara Bush was born on June 8, 1925, in New York City. The third of Marvin and Pauline Pierce’s four children, she enjoyed a privileged upbringing in suburban Rye, N.Y.Her father was publisher of McCall’s magazine and a distant relative of President Franklin Pierce. She remembered her mother, the daughter of an Ohio Supreme Court justice, as remote.In 1941, at 16, Barbara met George Bush, then a prep school senior, at a country club dance. She said later that his was the most beautiful face she had ever seen. He was the first boy she kissed; they were engaged a year later, just before George went to war as a Navy fighter pilot. They married on Jan. 6, 1945, while he was home on leave.After World War II, George Bush enrolled at Yale University, and they had their first child, George Walker Bush, the next year.As the Bush family grew, they moved from Texas, where Bush worked in the oil business, to five cities in California — Compton, Huntington Park, Bakersfield, Whittier and Ventura — in a single year. After they returned to Texas, he launched his political career in 1966 with a successful run for Congress.Before George Bush became Reagan’s vice presidential nominee in 1980, the family had lived in 27 homes in 36 years. The eight years they spent in the vice presidential mansion, from 1981 to 1989, were the longest the couple had lived in one place.Her husband was absent for long stretches when her children were young, which nurtured her bond with son George, who was seven years older than his next surviving sibling, John Ellis “Jeb” Bush, born in 1953. Sons Neil and Marvin followed in 1955 and 1956, and a daughter, Dorothy, in 1959.It was while caring for Robin in the eight months before she died that Bush’s hair started going gray. Friends said the Bushes got through their grief by supporting each other. Of that time, Bush told Time magazine in 1989: “George held me tight and wouldn’t let go.”Battling depression after her daughter died, Bush overheard 7-year-old George telling a friend that he couldn’t come out because he had to play with his mother, who was lonely. She later said that moment made her realize she needed to pull herself together.Yet as her husband rose in business and politics — through two terms in the House of Representatives, stints as U.N. ambassador and Republican Party chairman — she said she sometimes felt like a neglected homebody.She had trouble shaking the feeling that George was off “doing these exciting things,” Bush joked to Time, “and I’m sitting home with these absolutely brilliant children who say one thing a week of interest.”When George was appointed U.S. envoy to China in 1974, she became important to the enterprise and thrived. She called the 14 months in China her “chrysalis.”After returning to the United States in 1976, her husband became director of the CIA, and a veil of secrecy isolated her from his work. The growing women’s movement also made her question some of her life choices. By then, only daughter Dorothy was still at home. Barbara slipped into a depression, but brought herself out of it by touring the country with a slide show on China, a country virtually closed to Americans at the time.“I really love my life, but I could have chosen not to like it,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 1988. “I chose to like it.”When she was scheduled to speak at Wellesley College’s commencement in 1990, graduating seniors protested that Bush had been chosen because of her husband’s accomplishments. She delivered her speech as planned, and received support from prominent feminists, who saw the issue as one of respect for the different paths open to women.“At the end of your life,” she said in her speech, “you will never regret not … winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child or a parent.”After her husband lost his presidential bid for re-election to Bill Clinton in 1992, the Bushes built a home in Houston, and she delighted in being away from politics. She gardened and read voraciously.Her writings included the best-selling “Millie’s Book” (1990), told from the perspective of her English springer spaniel; it raised more than $1 million for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, which has awarded millions in grants. In 1984, she had written “C. Fred’s Story,” a wry look at Washington life, in the voice of the family’s cocker spaniel.During summers, the Bushes hosted the “grands,” as she called her 17 grandchildren, at the sprawling family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, that could sleep 34. Poking fun at her strict rules, the grandchildren called it “boot camp.”Repeatedly asked the secret to her long marriage, Bush often replied that a sense of humor was important. Sixty years after their wedding, she described her husband as “that 80-year-old whirlwind who makes my life sing.”(EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)Being the mother of a president did have one distinct drawback compared with being the president’s wife, she said in 2008. The criticism and campaign attacks that go with the territory “hurt much more if your son’s president.”She continued to offer sharp opinions, such as when she was asked in 2013 whether son Jeb should make a run for the Oval Office. “We’ve had enough Bushes,” she said.But she nonetheless was at his side when he jumped into the 2016 presidential contest. Traversing snow-battered New Hampshire with the aid of a walker, she greeted Republicans and implored them to make Jeb the third Bush to serve as president. The eventual primary winner, Donald Trump, mocked her son as “poor, poor, poor” Jeb, dependent on his mother.She also campaigned in South Carolina, a state whose primary Trump also won, prompting Jeb Bush to drop out of the race.Her view of the man who would become president, and whose success marked the end of Republican politics as practiced by her family, were evident during a CBS interview shortly before the New Hampshire contest. She dismissed Trump for misogynistic comments he made about then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly.“I don’t know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly,” Bush said.She added a criticism of Trump that spoke of her, and her family’s view of public service: “Money doesn’t buy everything. It’s accomplishments and what you’re doing and giving. It’s incomprehensible to me.”In 2013, during an interview with CSPAN for a series on first ladies, Bush looked ahead to the circumstances that would close her remarkable life.“I have no fear of death,” she said, then joked: “Which is a huge comfort, because we’re getting darn close!”",N/A,"

14,"Purdue pitching coach Steve Holm was a big part of the Boilermakers’ quick two-year turnaround, earning him the opportunity to become the head coach at Illinois State.ISU Director of Athletics Larry Lyons announced the hiring of the former big leaguer Friday. Holm joined Purdue in the summer of 2016 after beginning his coaching career as an assistant at Sacramento State (2013-16). Head coach Mark Wasikowski and his two-year assistants Wally Crancer and Holm reshaped a program that was 10-44 in 2016 into an NCAA Regional qualifier with a 38-21 record just two seasons later.“Steve is a very smart and well-calculated baseball mind,” Wasikowski said in a press release. “He was a critical part of the Purdue baseball program’s turnaround over the last two years. Illinois State made an outstanding decision hiring Coach Holm. He is a proven winner!“With our program going in the right direction, Boilermakers are going to be in high demand. That applies to both the MLB Draft and opportunities for our assistant coaches. He earned an opportunity to be a head coach with his great work an assistant, both at Purdue and Sacramento State. He had a huge impact on the big improvements of our pitching staff. I couldn’t be happier for Steve, his bride Lindsey, and his wonderful young family!”""I am extremely excited to be the new head coach at Illinois State University,"" Holm said. ""I'd like to thank Dr. Larry Dietz, Larry Lyons, and Peyton Deterding for trusting me to lead the program and the 35 young men within it. There are a lot of people who have helped me get to this point, including both Reggie Christiansen and Mark Wasikowski. I am forever grateful to both of them for the opportunity they gave me as an assistant coach. Most importantly I'd like to thank each and every one of my players who have played for me. I promised my wife when she moved to California that I'd get her back close to her Midwest roots and without the efforts of those players this never would have been possible.""Holm's pitching staff was a big part of Purdue's 38-win season and NCAA Regional bid in 2018. The Boilermakers qualified for the NCAA Tournament for just the third time in program history thanks to an 8-1 start and 21-3 surge from April 20 to May 27. The pitching staff compiled a 3.01 ERA and 1.34 WHIP during the memorable 24-game run late in the season, which featured a pair of 13-game win streaks (overall and home).After the season, staff ace Tanner Andrews was selected in the 10th round of the MLB Draft by the Miami Marlins. He was Purdue's highest-drafted pitcher since 2012. Closer Ross Learnard registered a program-record 15 saves and earned third team All-America honors from Collegiate Baseball. After Learnard’s single-season record 0.58 ERA led to second team All-America honors from the NCBWA in 2017, he became the first Boilermaker to be a full-fledged All-American in consecutive seasons.In Holm's two years with the Boilermakers, the team ERA improved from 5.27 in 2016 to 4.91 in 2017 to 4.00 in 2018. The team WHIP dropped from 1.61 in 2016 to 1.44 in 2018. After being a catcher in pro ball, Holm also helped the team's catchers improve defensively. Nick Dalesandro started the final 33 games of the season at catcher and was also drafted in the 10th round this year. But most importantly, the Boilermakers’ 28-win improvement from 2016 to 2018 will go down as one of the most dramatic and ascendant turnarounds in the history of Purdue Athletics. The Boilermakers ended a four-year Big Ten Tournament drought in 2017 and finished second in the Big Ten this season, both in the final standings and at the conference tournament.""Our goal was to find the best person to lead our baseball program back to the top of the Missouri Valley Conference and to compete for postseason opportunities. In addition, we were looking for the best person to continue our high level of academic success and personal development of the young men in our program. Steve brings all of that and many more intangibles,"" Lyons said.""We feel Steve's background as an All-American shortstop, a professional catcher and collegiate pitching coach gives him the ability to make our team immediately better in every facet of the game. His success in helping programs improve in relatively short periods of time is impressive, and we are very excited Steve and his family have chosen to join the Redbird family.”",N/A,"

15,"The Greater Lafayette Area will be getting one step closer to the technology of tomorrow as CityBus plans on updating their bus software.CityBus received a grant earlier this April from the Federal Transit Administration. This nearly half-million dollar grant, along with local funds, will be used for purchasing new technology to reduce crashes and ensure consumer safety. The software will help detect nearby pedestrians and cyclists, and alert the driver using colored lights mounted to the dashboard, along with a warning sound.“Little cameras on the back (of the buses),” general manager Martin Sennett said, will keep the detection program aware of nearby obstacles to look out for.According to a CityBus press release, each installation of the system will cost about $8,000 dollars per bus. The cost is more than worth the expense, though, to keep locals safe and accidents down.Out of the 73 buses CityBus owns and the hundreds of thousands of miles they drive every month, Sennett says there are about two to five accidents a month. This new software should help reduce that statistic, according to Sennett.While this new program doesn’t brake the bus automatically for the driver, completely automated fleets of buses that don’t require drivers at all are not so far off.Purdue’s own Discovery Park is working on research that may lead to normalizing autonomous cars on the interstate in as little as 10 years, according to director of the Joint Transportation Research Program Darcy Bullock.CityBus’ new detection system “is a gateway into” autonomous buses, Bullock said in an interview. “Anything we can do” to help reduce accidents is good for the community, including working toward completely automated cars.Bullock’s work at the Discovery Research Learning Center hinges around traffic signals, and the messages they can send to automated cars.“Sensing is critical,” Bullock said, noting that the three most important parts of making autonomous cars are “signs, signals and markings.”This research may not be that far off for simple routes like state roads or highways, but Bullock said getting that kind of automation to college campuses will be slightly harder. Places like school zones and university campuses will be some of the last zones to have automated transportation system due to the unpredictability of the environment, with students running in front of cars or between vehicles posing a real problem.Despite this, the future of autonomous cars and fleets of buses are not as far off into the future as some might think, and though CityBus won’t have robotic buses anytime soon, their new detection system may be the first step toward a safer, more reliable future.",N/A,"

18,"In the garden behind the big, white mansion that houses the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, nine high schoolers milled around and skirted black boxes on the bare, sun-warmed planks of the museum’s newly erected stage.While three camp counselors scooted chairs all around the grass in an attempt to stay out of the sun, a leafy tree arced over the stage and shaded the performers from the worst of the 90-degree heat.“I make ‘em bear it,” head camp counselor and director Andrew Wolverton said with a grin. “I’m very hot and sweaty here. … As long as we stay well-hydrated, we’ll be alright.”Despite the heat, the members of the Civic Youth Summer Theatre Institute have continued to prepare a play about a group of summer campers for this weekend’s fourth annual ""Theatre in the Garden"" series. “Make It Happen” was created by local playwright Laurie Russell specifically for the Theatre Institute, and its actors are mostly from Harrison and West Lafayette high schools.Friday’s and Saturday’s 7 p.m. performances will mark the first time the summer campers perform on a real stage. Ellie Haan, founder of the Haan Museum, said construction on the stage started several months ago. Bob Haan and Steve Winetrout, the stage’s primary builders, are putting finishing touches on it this week in preparation for the concerts and plays to take place this weekend.Bob Haan and Steve Winetrout are putting the finishing touches on the newly built stage in the Haan Museum's Theater Garden.“It feels a lot more professional,” said Addie Gorden, a senior in high school and a two-time veteran of the summer camp that the Civic Theatre of Greater Lafayette organizes each year. Performing on the ground meant there was no separation between the actors and the audience. The grass was always full of bugs and much harder to sit on than a flat stage.Wolverton said the decision to build a stage in the garden is great for his students. The lack of fancy equipment encourages the students to take ownership of the show.They don’t have wings or lights to work with, but they practiced moving benches and boxes around to distinguish between scenes and plan to hang canopies at the edges of the stage.At the moment, transitions between scenes involve a camp counselor shouting “music, music, music, I can’t sing,” but the Haans installed electric outlets in the stage that will allow the students to use a sound system for the actual performances.“You definitely have to be a little more creative with transitions,” Wolverton said.For the past few years the summer camp has performed Shakespeare, but the more modern script allows the students to incorporate more of the skills they’ve been studying throughout the three-week summer camp, including scripted and unscripted improvisation games as well as the monologues the students used to audition for the show.Olivia Zaragoza, a sophomore in high school who plays Serena and the narrator in “Make It Happen,” said the improv games were the most challenging part of their camp experience so far. She and Gorden argued over whether “Foursquare,” the “No P” game or the “Questions” game was the hardest they’d played.“You have to just go with your first idea and work off the people around you,” Gorden said. The games could be difficult when she or the people around her had a hard time coming up with ideas in the first place.Despite the difficulties the students faced as they sought to improve their acting skills, the students have found it easy to get along. According to Gorden, it normally takes a few days for everyone to warm up to each other, but this year’s group was friendly from the get-go.Zaragoza pointed out that the group did do trust falls the very first day of camp, each person taking turns falling into the group’s arms on the tall, grassy area above the stage. Wolverton made her go second, even though she didn’t like being so high up.“I’m not scared of heights anymore,” she joked, glancing at Gorden with a smile.The Theater in the Garden performance is an opportunity for high schoolers to practice their acting skills more than they might get to during the school year. It’s also an opportunity for the Haan Museum to offer more events in their Theater Garden, which is free and open to the public 24 hours a day.“We’re looking to have a lot more things out here,” Ellie Haan said.",N/A,"

19,"It has been NBA everything for the past few months, even in the college basketball scene.Three former Purdue men’s basketball players are awaiting the results of tonight’s NBA Draft, and two current players tested the waters with NBA coaches earlier this spring.With summer workouts getting underway, though, Purdue’s returning players are focusing their efforts on improving for another season with the Boilermakers.After an autograph session with summer basketball campers, the players made their way into the hallway leading to Cardinal Court for a pre-workout media session.Sophomore guard Nojel Eastern speaks with media members on June 20, immediately prior to the team's summer workouts.Sophomore guard Nojel Eastern leaned casually against the wall, recounting his experience working out with the Atlanta Hawks and the Boston Celtics before withdrawing his name from consideration in the draft.During that time, Eastern said teams talked to him about how to shape his game to be NBA-ready when the time comes.Finding a way to improve his shooting abilities, he said, was something he heard often. But coaches were also interested in how he utilized his strong, 220-pound frame, a point Eastern himself was keen on capitalizing on.Players like Ben Simmons and LeBron James, he said, are big, drive-first players he thinks he can model his game after.He was quick to acknowledge he’s not taking James’ place anytime soon, though.“I’m not saying I’m going to be LeBron,” Eastern said. “But, ya'know, we have similar characteristics, being a bigger guard than your position.”Posted against the wall opposite of Eastern was junior guard Carsen Edwards, who also put himself in front of NBA teams this spring.Edwards was given the chance to play in the NBA combine in May, where his performance didn’t meet the standards he’s set for himself.“Personally, I don’t think I played well at the combine,” he said.But he remains optimistic about his future professional prospects.“I still have so much to work on as a player,” Edwards said. “But if that’s the level you have to be at to play in the NBA, or even be considered in the NBA, I believe I can play with those guys.”Three of Purdue’s seniors who graduated in May are hoping to hear their names called in this evening’s NBA draft. Here in West Lafayette, they’re receiving plenty of support from their former teammates.“I’m excited for them,” sophomore forward Matt Haarms said, a stray strand of his now-famous, flipped-back hair dangling down toward his eye. “I know how hard they worked all those four years. They were insanely hard workers. And now, even when they're not here anymore they're still really working hard, working out for a bunch of teams. So I'll definitely be watching the draft and hoping to see their names called.”Even with all of the NBA talk going around the Boiler locker room, the players acknowledged it was time to buckle down in Mackey Arena in preparation for another successful run through March.Eastern said the hype shouldn’t be much of a distraction.“I live in the moment, ya'know. I lived in that moment when I was working out with NBA teams. It was a great experience, but now I’m back at Purdue. I’m living in the moment. Now I just want to win. Try to get to the final four. Try to help my teammates get better. Try to help myself get better.”Purdue junior guard Carsen Edwards speaks with members of the media prior to the June 20 team workouts with the coaching staff.As the media finished up and players filed into Cardinal Court, Edwards headed toward the locker room. Painter called after him, telling him practice was in the other direction.Edwards, however, needed to freshen up.“This shirt smells funky,” he said, tugging at his bright yellow shirt.Like Edwards, the Boilermakers will try to freshen up this summer, adjusting their style of play to fit their new personnel.“We’re a different team than we were last year,” Haarms said.",N/A,"

20,"In 2017, there were 93 confirmed cases of human trafficking in Indiana alone and over 8,000 reported cases in the United States.Indiana is one of many states affected by the problem of human trafficking, and being the famous “Crossroads of America” means Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and many other cities with trafficking problems are just a short drive away for traffickers to transport victims.Monday afternoon, Holy Trinity Lutheran Church hosted a Human Trafficking seminar to educate people on the horrors of human trafficking. The seminar has 3 sessions in total over the course of three days.Morgan Bow, the Region 4 Coalition Coordinator from the Indiana Trafficking Victims Assistant Program, trained the public on what human trafficking is and identified red flags to help better identify possible victims of trafficking.ITVAP is a grant funded organization focused on youth advocacy, delinquency prevention, informations and referrals, and community education in Indiana. They also work with 31 youth service bureaus on victim support.Tuesday, the Lafayette Police department presented and on Wednesday an attorney from the Indiana Attorney General’s Office closed out the seminar.In the church’s sanctuary, surrounded by stain glass windows, Bow started by showing a clip. The video was of Aubrey Lloyd, a survivor of sex trafficking, that had worked with ITVAP to create a series of videos. Throughout the event, clips of Aubrey Lloyd were shown to give a perspective on what trafficking is actually like from someone who has experienced it firsthand.Many hold misconceptions about human trafficking. It isn’t simply a white van with blacked-out windows, snatching someone and disappearing forever.Trafficking takes many forms, but this Hollywood depiction is far less common than many believe. In reality recruitment of a possible victim can take many months of “investment,” as Bow put it. Traffickers will often appear friendly and eventually manipulate someone into feeling alone, scared or desperate.Bow touched on a common question: Why don’t these victims just leave? In reality these traffickers use force, fraud, and coercion to manipulate victims into doing what they want, Bow said. Oftentimes, traffickers will isolate victims and use emotional abuse, economic abuse, threats and physical abuse to ensure that these victims won’t escape.During the event, Bow defined a human-trafficking victim as a person who is forced into involuntary servitude, marriage, commercial sexual conduct or any minor engaged in commercial sexual conduct.Human trafficking is prevalent nearly everywhere in the U.S., according to the Polaris Project.In January, the problem became apparent locally. Darius Jamal Brown, 27, was arrested for human trafficking, promoting prostitution and providing alcohol to minors — all right in Lafayette. Some of the industries most vulnerable to trafficking are domestic work, restaurants, health & beauty, massage parlors, construction or forestry sites, agriculture and door to door sales. Some of these, such as forestry or construction, are known as the “unseen industries” according to Bow because nobody ever questions what they see at a construction site. The site is either empty, or people appear to be working but no one would ever know if some of the workers are forced, unpaid labor.The Polaris Project’s website says labor trafficking has increased but remains underreported because of a lack of awareness.The number for the Indiana Child Abuse Hotline is 800-800-5556 and for National Human Trafficking Hotline is 888-37-37-888.",N/A,"

21,"Purdue University’s campus was abuzz Tuesday with high school students in town for the 89th Indiana Future Farmers of America State Convention. Students from chapters all across the state participated in several activities throughout the day, including leadership building and community service.Over 100 students participated in a community service project for Lafayette Transitional Housing. Students, faculty mentors and FFA officers gathered in the Wilmeth Active Learning Center to make tie blankets for members of the community.In a span of two hours, the group of volunteers made 250 blankets. Before the blankets could be delivered to community members in need, they were cut, tied and had the FFA patch sewn on.Carrie Guillaume, a Perry Central FFA club faculty advisor, sat with her students and helped them make a tie blanket as part of their service. While working with them, she was reminded of her days in FFA and the skills she learned.“FFA is more than just sows and plows,” Guillaume said. “They live to serve others, it’s their motto. They learn more leadership skills and more life skills through their activities as FFA members.”Josh Miller, an incoming Purdue freshman, said that agriculture is something he has always loved — a passion he will take with him into his studies as an Agronomy student.Students in FFA do not have to come from an agriculture background. Through chapter activities, students will learn life skills that they can use in their future career outside of agriculture.Lynley Arnholt, a junior at Columbus East High School, said that she loves agriculture. She grew up around her grandfather’s hog farm, but she doesn’t have plans to go into the profession. She is pursuing a career in medicine after high school.“Learning (about agriculture provides) better insight into how we get our food,” Arnholt said.National FFA President Breanna Holbert is a member who did not come from a traditional agriculture background. She said she comes from an urban area but finds agriculture to be an underdog in the eyes of many people. She says she has a soft spot for the underdog in any situation.“Agriculture is the base of our country,” Holbert said. “There’s a big disconnect between people now and farmers.”",N/A,"

Todd Rokita, a Brownsburg Republican who was first elected in the 4th District in 2010.Here was the question I put to each one: What, if any, changes to gun laws would you advocate that you believe could prevent or minimize the damage of mass shootings, such as the ones at Las Vegas, Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida?Here’s what they said.Steve Braun: This tragedy is unspeakably sad. As a country, we cannot let the aftermath of this to become a bitter and divisive debate that leads to more political dysfunction. The evil actions of this young man will undergo a comprehensive investigation by local law enforcement and the FBI.  We need to focus on this crime and understand fully where his path intersected with our health care and legal system and whether anything could have been done to identify the threat and prevent his actions.  Campaign link: Steve Braun Diego Morales: The Second Amendment is not what kills people.  Evil actions by disturbed individuals are behind tragedies like these.  We need to focus on mental health and treatment, not restricting the rights of responsible gun owners.Campaign link: Diego Morales Bangert: Indiana's Sen. Young, a top NRA friend, grilled for his school shooting ‘prayers’Bangert: Q&A: Purdue's Terese Marie Mailhot on her tough new memoirBangert: Who's behind the anti-KKK posters pasted across downtown Lafayette James Nease: It's harder today to purchase a gun than it was in 1940 yet school shootings have increased by 800 percent since then, while antidepressant usage and zero-tolerance policies have also increased astronomically during this time period. Every school shooter to date that has failed to commit suicide has listed reasonings for the shooting, which include social isolation, messiah complex, feelings of contempt and anger at rejection and a multitude of other behaviors that coincide with mental illness.It is my opinion that pharmaceutical companies, schools and even parental figures have done outstanding damage to our youth by force feeding them black-box warning medications and continuing to isolate these teenagers with policies that are often ""punish first, help later"" that do not specifically help address mental illness and social despondency, but rather exacerbate it.As long as our solution is to medicate, as long as mental health care is far too expensive and out of reach, and as long as schools and parents are OK with suspensions, expulsions and sometimes throwing teens into the judicial system for abnormal behavior, you will continue to see a rise in antisocial behavior that often leads to acts of violence on self or others. My advice is stop drugging your kids, stop letting them sink hours into video games instead of socializing, and actually take your kids to get professional help instead of ignoring very obvious signs of distress.Campaign link: James Nease Jared Guy Thomas:  Given these recent tragedies, now is not a time to step away from this challenge. I believe there is a way to protect the American public — especially our children — by reviewing, revising and enacting sensible gun laws (such as expanding and enhancing our background check programs), while still preserving our Second Amendment rights.This cannot end with a simple review of our gun laws, however. We need to undertake an education campaign that works with our communities to arm them with the information necessary to identify the warning signs of individuals who may be on the verge of committing these atrocities. We need to work to destigmatize mental illness and treat it for what it is — a disease. We need to work with our medical communities to provide them with the resources necessary to effectively treat people with mental illness. We need to work with our schools to ensure they are safe places for our kids to grow physically and mentally. Our teachers, guidance counselors and administrators need to receive continual education to recognize and respond to at-risk groups within the student population. We need to effectively deal with bullying and help foster a school community that seeks to reduce the chances for individual students to become isolated and radicalized in their thinking.This complex issue requires a societal approach that includes so much more than gun laws. Elected leaders should not be hesitant to tackle this problem. We must do something now — the future of our country and the safety of our children demand action.Campaign link: Jared Guy Thomas Did not immediately respond: Jim Baird and Tim Radice. Kevin Grant, listed as a candidate on May ballots, says he has withdrawn from the race.Tobi Beck: In the 1970s, the No. 1 killer of Americans was cars. In order to solve this problem, we began with the understanding that we were not going to give up our cars, but we were not going to continue to allow lives to be lost. So, we researched and analyzed and came up with a variety of sensible ways to protect lives. We lowered the speed limit, banked the roads, put up railings, made brighter break lights, created three-point restraint systems and more. This work happened because we were willing to be creative and face the issues at hand, rather than sit on our hands out of fear of action and accountability. Why is this any different than firearms?Rather than act, we have taken steps backwards – we passed legislation that eliminated manufacturers’ responsibility for their own firearms and halted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studies on gun deaths. We have potential solutions we could implement, all of which would protect our Second Amendment rights while protecting our and our children’s lives. We must not be afraid of action – until  we embrace it, we will continue to have these tragedies.Campaign link: Tobi Beck Roger Day: If we had both houses and the White House, we could pass laws that don't take away a person’s right to own firearms. But we could pass laws to control types of weapons, and we could restrict ammo, as well as tag ammo. We could pass bills to have a waiting period, long enough to do a complete examination, including social media. Weapons designed to kill people – weapons of war – would be illegal except on a range. They would have to be kept on range at all times. Have the 80 percent of NRA members who agree with some gun control withdraw their support and dry up the money used to buy politicians.Ballotpedia link: Roger Day Darin Griesey: To close the gun show loop hole, comprehensive instant background checks for all purchases, increased testing for a concealed carry permit, and increasing the purchase age to 21. Please allow me to state that I have been a gun owner hunter for most of my life. I received my first gun when I was 10, and sat through the Indiana Department of Natural Resources hunter education course when I was 11. I come from a long line of conservationist sportsmen, and see absolutely no reason for people to have access to military style weapons for the sake of hunting.
A majority of mass shooting gun crimes in this country are attributed to the fact that someone was willing to do wrong to another, and the victim was able to access a firearm in retaliation. When we can learn to live in peace and in mutual edification, only then will the gun problem be solved.Campaign link: Darin GrieseyJoe Mackey: As bright as we all like to think we are, the best answer to your question won’t come from any one individual. I believe we should hold a national referendum in the general election this coming November. Let’s put the assault weapon issue before the American people and lay it to rest. Let’s clarify for all to see where the American people stand on assault weapons, magazine capacity, ammunition tax, ownership rights and liabilities. I challenge all parties running for office to support this referendum, and I further challenge those elected to office to honor the results. Campaign link: Joe MackeyVeronikka Ziol: As a gun owner myself, I know that something must be done. Some people claim that America doesn’t have a gun problem, but it’s mental illness that’s to blame. And yet, last year, Congress stripped a provision put in place by the Obama administration attempting to prevent access to firearms by certain people with mental illness. However, I‘m just as certain that exacerbating the stigma surrounding mental health isn’t getting to the crux of the problem. …That said, one change that I would absolutely make is repealing the restrictions prohibiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from investigating gun deaths as the public health crises that they are. And to make certain that they are fully funded to complete that research. Unfortunately, it seems that to the current people in power the word science is a bad word to never be uttered in polite company. We cannot solve a problem without fully understanding why it occurs. A gun is a tool. A tool which is designed for killing. A hunter does it for food. But without the science that research performed by the CDC would provide, we won’t understand the motivations behind these mass shooters.One more point of which I'm certain: ""thoughts and prayers"" aren't going to solve this. Hard science, facts and the policies based on that data will.Campaign link:Veronikka ZiolDid not immediately respond: Ronald Ellis.ABOUT THE ELECTION: Indiana’s primary will be May 8.

1,"As we grieve over the terrible mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, we have to ask ourselves why this type of horror occurs repeatedly. Also why isn't anything being done to prevent it from happening again?It's not a case of unchecked  terrorism, for which we have numerous effective safeguards. It's a question of indifference on some people's part, and of a type of fear that has gripped our elected officials, including President Trump. They're afraid of the National Rifle Association, which  warns politicians not to enact any gun control legislation or face the wrath of that organization. The NRA will work actively to defeat those officials at the polls. Do we not have any representatives with the courage and conviction to oppose the NRA, which callously blocks legislation of the type that is needed? It reminds one of the McCarthy era of the 1950s, when public servants were afraid to speak out against the Senate demagogue from Wisconsin.Now is the time to stand up to the NRA and begin limiting acquisition of weapons like the AR-15. It is the type of firearm used most often in mass killings. At the same time, we need to do a better job of identifying homicidal, mentally disturbed individuals and treating them. We should urge our elected representatives to do both — control the circulation of military-style weapons and help treat the psychologically unbalanced — so that we can avert disasters like the one in Parkland.David ParrishWest LafayetteYour turnSubmit letters to the editor of 250 words or fewer to editor@jconline.com or to 823 Park East Blvd., Lafayette, IN 47905.

4,"This week, Congress debates House Bill 38, also known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017. The intention of concealed carry reciprocity is to allow people legally permitted to carry concealed weapons to do so throughout all states, akin to a driver’s license.The consequence of this legislation however, will be to enable people with dangerous histories and no training to carry loaded, concealed guns across state lines.This is not hyperbolic. Right now, 19 states (like Georgia, and Alabama) don’t require any gun safety training in order to carry concealed guns in public; 12 states (like Arizona and Idaho) don’t require a permit or background check, while still others allow domestic abusers or people convicted of violent misdemeanors to concealed carry. During the committee markup of the bill, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, was forced to admit that the bill allows people with violent misdemeanor convictions to carry concealed weapons across the country.Congress should reject Concealed Carry Reciprocity, and pass a clean “Fix NICS Act,” which has won wide bipartisan support, will improve reporting of dangerous people to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and will improve safety of communities across the country.Kathy ParkerWest LafayetteYour turnSubmit letters to the editor of 250 words or fewer to editor@jconline.com or to 823 Park East Blvd., Lafayette, IN 47905.

But they also had other suggestions, such as an assault rifle ban. ""I worry about your force going against someone with 13 rifles,"" Dr. Seema Kengeri said.Dombkowski called for bump stocks to be banned but said he sees similar dangers from both pistols and semiautomatic weapons when it comes to school shootings.

This (pistol), we may not,"" he said. What about having more armed guards?Dombkowski agreed with the suggestion, adding students and parents should also alert police when they see troubling behaviors from others. But he disagreed with the idea of arming teachers, proposed by President Donald Trump and others, saying police officers go through hours of training that teachers typically don't.More: Bangert: Greater Lafayette teachers blast Donald Trump's call for armed classroomsDombkowski assured the residents that their community is safe and their police department is prepared. He said police officers have learned a lot of lessons from an active shooter incident at Purdue University in 2014.""Training does count,"" he said.He also used an incident from early this month as an example of when the local police's system worked to prevent those with violent tendencies from acting on it. More: Police: Former Purdue student found with cache of weapons, ammunition""It's about making sure we get it right as often as we can,"" Dombkowski said.But for Kendall Tran, a freshman at West Lafayette High School, her memory of a lockdown four years ago from a school shooting threat remains fresh. She remembers sprinting to classrooms and seeing friends too scared to move under their desks.Tran agreed with a lot of what Dombkowski said, but she still wants to push state and federal legislators to do more. ""(Gun violence) is not a blister. It's a wound,"" Tran said.

Administrators at Faith Christian High School and Oakland High School could not be reached for comment by Monday afternoon. West Lafayette High School is on spring break this week. Those who responded to the request said they are confident that students will act in ways that are safe and productive. ""We are confident that any students who want to participate will work within (our) parameters,"" Harrison  Principal Cory Marshall said.Here is what each high school will do on Wednesday:Jefferson If all goes well, students will walk out of the school and onto the sidewalks of the 18th Street and other roads. Then, they will hold hands to form a student ""halo"" around the school buildings. The entire protest will be done silently and voluntarily. No signs or chants will be allowed.""We are going to let our action speak louder than our chants,"" said Julia Maxwell, a senior who is helping to organize the protest. ""I hope students realize this is so much bigger than themselves."" Lafayette police will be there, as well as teachers who don't have any classes at the time. They will provide security for the students.Principal Mark Preston said the school's goal is to make sure the protest is organized. The school has a strategic plan to have students in and out of its campus. ""We are not going to say '2,000 students: Go out and organize into halo,' "" he said. Central Catholic Students will walk into the school's gym during their homeroom period, starting at 9:40 a.m. Then, they will have prayer and reflection sessions for those who lost their lives in school shootings around the country, including at Parkland.

7,"LAFAYETTE, Ind. – When President Donald Trump last week floated the idea that on path to safer classrooms in the wake of 17 killed in a Florida school was to arm teachers – even giving bonuses to those willing to do it – West Lafayette High School teacher Randy Studt said he set out to find a colleague in his district who was ready to answer that call.Studt, who teaches German and is co-president of the West Lafayette Education Association, was still looking on Friday, about the time Trump was telling the Conservative Political Action Conference that if guns had been in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School classrooms, “a teacher would've shot the hell out of (the gunman).”“I’m not hearing about anyone who’s interested,” Studt said. “I’m hearing people are scared that this is even being mentioned. That includes people who say they’d be willing to retire first. But I’m also talking about people just starting their careers who are saying, ‘That’s not what I thought I was signing up for.'“It’s just such a bad idea.”On Thursday, state Sen. Jim Tomes, an Evansville Republican, proposed a Senate resolution that called for a study into whether Indiana should give school districts the option to allow teachers to carry concealed weapons on their campuses. Indiana already allows school boards some discretion over allowing guns on their campuses.The resolution, which hadn’t been scheduled for a hearing as of Friday, specifically mentions two high-profile school massacres – the one Feb. 14 at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and one in 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut, where 26 students and teachers were killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary. Tomes’ resolution quotes a 2014 FBI study that 66.9 percent of active shooter incidents between 2000 and 2013 ended before police could arrive.Whether Tomes’ resolution will go anywhere, Studt said he took it seriously that a lawmaker was making the suggestion that armed guard was going to be added to the teachers’ job expectations.More: Indiana schools can arm teachers, but most don't. More might start.Bangert: Indiana's Sen. Young, a top NRA friend, grilled for his school shooting ‘prayers’In the 4th District: School shootings and gun laws, in the words of our next U.S. rep in Congress “Ask for yourself,” Studt said. “Try to find someone in a classroom who says they’re for it. If there are, they’re not saying it out loud – at least not to me. … Seriously, ask teachers.”Fair enough.Here are some voices of teachers, active and retired, in Greater Lafayette.Julie Sumrall, English teacher, Lafayette Jefferson High School: Just no. I can't even believe we are at a point where this is even considered. It is an insult to our profession to even make such a suggestion, and it completely ignores the true problem we address facing in America today. It's amazing to me that there are people who would suggest arming a bunch of literature majors somehow protects our school children, while completely dismissing any talk of gun control. It's almost like they don't like students; surely that isn't true. Just no.Brittanni Eavey, sixth-grade math teacher, Northridge Middle School, Crawfordsville: I’m on the fence with the debate. Personally, I wouldn’t want a gun in my classroom, but I feel confident that others in my school might. We are always on a soft lockdown while school is in session, which is comforting, but if someone wants to produce harm, they will find a way. We have a school resource officer that I see often within a week – sometimes multiple times a day. I feel confident he will do a much better job at protecting my students and colleagues with firearms than I ever could.Travis Rubeck, sixth-grade teacher, Roosevelt Middle School, Monticello: I think that any society that has to arm its teachers is no longer a society. At that point, it's time to go back to the drawing board and try again. We are the only developed country that has this gun problem, and it's time we figure out why.Kristine Kealey, former English teacher, Lafayette Jefferson, Harrison and Benton Central high schools: The idea of teachers carrying is absurd at best. However, one proposal that I have not seen out there is the need to keep schools smaller. Having taught in a small school (Benton Central), and two large schools, I know the real difference a small school can make in the relationships the teachers have with the kids and the sense of community that a small school has. I graduated from West Lafayette High School, and my kids are there largely because every teacher knows every kid there. Of course, this is an argument that I have espoused since I was getting my teaching degree from Purdue. The research is out there. Unfortunately, creating smaller schools is very cost-prohibitive given the current way public schools are funded.Abby McClure, second/third-grade, Burnett Creek Elementary, Tippecanoe School Corp.: I think absolutely not. Scenario: let’s say it’s in a safe. Then a lockdown drill happens. I am expected to get my kids hidden and safe, close and lock my door, turn off the lights, close the blinds, and then get my gun? Are you kidding? We have seconds – maybe. Overall, I’m so frustrated that this issue has gone back to the schools. After Columbine, schools took precautions. We started practicing lock down drills, we changed school security, and we did our part to make school safer. We need help. Arm me with resources to help my students mentally, emotionally and socially. Arm me with professional development so I can learn how to recognize students who need support. Arm me with counselors and social workers and people who can help my students feel better. Let’s create resources for our students with special needs so they can learn to be independent and function in society. I don’t want a gun. I will refuse to carry a gun. I won’t work in a place where that is expected. Maggie Smith, a retired teacher at Miller Elementary, Lafayette: To arm teachers is totally ludicrous. None of the truly dedicated teachers I have worked with over the years would choose arming themselves and being paid a bonus. A bonus that would take money that school corporations don't have. Will they cut more from the budget for textbooks, classroom supplies or those teachers who choose not to arm themselves? I don't know what the answer is, I just know it's not more guns.Randy Brist, radio-TV teacher, Lafayette Jefferson High School: Guns in the classroom? Teachers packing heat? With this logic, I suspect soon that ministers and priests, movie theater managers, coaches, lifeguards, Scout leaders, bus drivers – the list goes on – should also be trained. We wouldn't want some little handgun. We'd need an assault rifle to match the bad guy's weapons. The problem is and has been the ridiculously easy access to assault weapons. More guns are not a solution. They simply add to the problem.Al Enlow, third-grade teacher, Cumberland Elementary, West Lafayette: Arming educators will only present more challenges. School staffs are stretched to the limit now meeting expectations in so many areas. There is no need to add ""public safety"" to the list. We have outstanding people who have, thankfully, chosen to protect us. For them, I am extremely thankful. They are the trained professionals. I also don't want students to see adults choosing to solve problems by arming themselves; this sends the message we want to get away from nationally. We don't solve violence with violence, and arming educators is implying this is how the problem is solved even though that is not the intent.Micky Houston, retired teacher, Miller Elementary, Lafayette: I taught for over 40 years, and I have heard a lot of crazy ideas of what teachers should do proposed by others, but this takes the cake on the crazy meter. Never would I do this nor would I want to be placed in a building where other teachers are packing weapons. This is total nonsense.If you’re a Greater Lafayette teacher ready to prove Studt’s theory wrong, my contact information is at the bottom.Reach J&C columnist Dave Bangert at 765-420-5258 or at dbangert@jconline.com.

8,"Throughout my career as an educator and administrator, I have worked with many stellar teachers and staff members.  I see their work every day, and I know the time they put in to help all of their students succeed.  Also, I have worked with many policymakers.  It’s my opinion that the vast majority of them are trying to do the right things for the constituents they represent.The recent debate about arming teachers has been around for many years. First, I believe this should be a local decision.  This should not be mandated by any legislature. Second, I find it troubling to suggest that we pay teachers more if they agree to carry a firearm when many teachers are trying to find funds just to provide their students with the extra instructional supplies.  Many teachers and staff members pay for supplies out of their own pocket. Related: Threats made at Jeff not credible, LSC superintendent saysMore: Bangert: Greater Lafayette teachers blast Donald Trump's call for armed classroomsThird, carrying a firearm should be relegated to those who have extensive training and expertise.  What happens when a teacher with little experience in using a firearm accidentally shoots someone?So what can be done to make our schools safer? First, we need to invest in human capital.  The more teachers, staff members and counselors we have in our schools, the better chance there is of finding and assisting children who need help. This is especially true as more and more teachers leave the profession and with the ongoing teacher shortage.  The current debate is one of many reasons for this.  As I heard one teacher say, “You want to trust me with a gun, but you don’t trust me with curriculum, instruction and assessments.” Second, if we are serious about making our schools safer, rather than the U.S. spending nearly $1.7 billion on standardized testing, use those resources to place trained school resource officers in every school and for school security grants to improve facilities. Third, policymakers should consider some kind accountability for parents.   Teachers and staff members are held accountable for many things outside of their control.  Maybe policymakers should look at holding parents accountable as well, especially when a child has access to a weapon at home and brings it to school.There is no easy solution for the current situation.  Each of us will have our own remedies based upon our respective experiences.  One thing I do know:  We should listen to the people who are doing work.  We should listen to our teachers, staff members and law enforcement officials.  Also, there should be some kind accountability for parents.  Teachers and schools cannot do it alone.Killion is superintendent of the West Lafayette Community School Corp.","[<span class=""asset-metabar-time asset-metabar-item nobyline"">
