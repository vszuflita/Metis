1,"Clinton ran gun control as a candidate in the 2016 election and lost. President Trump ran as pro-gun and LMT Online reports that Clinton is now criticizing him for standing with gun rights organizations.She said Trump “did everything he could to ingratiate himself with the gun lobby, and is now doing everything he can to gut existing laws.”Despite losing the election, Clinton claimed that “the vast majority of Americans” support the gun control position, adding, “So we are winning the debate. But now we’ve got to get everyone to vote on this issue.”Clinton pointed to school shootings as a justification for more gun control. She talked of the February 14, 2018, Parkland shooting in which a gunman shot and killed 17. She also mentioned the April 20, 1999, Columbine High School attack, in which 13 were killed.She did not mention that the Parkland attacker passed a background check to acquire his rifle nor did she point out that the Columbine attack happened at a time when the Democrats’ prized gun control, the “assault weapons” ban, was in effect.Clinton was also mum on the fact that Parkland and Columbine were both gun-free zones.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

2,"The Orlando Sentinel reports that “four firearms and 267 rounds of ammunition” were taken from the man, and he was “taken to a hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment.”The seized firearms were listed as “a Ruger LCP .380 pistol, an M2 Mauser .45 pistol, a Charter Arms .357 mag snub nose revolver and a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun.”The paper notes that “the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under … new legislation — which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward’s Chief Judge Jack Tuter.”The confiscatory order also bars the man from making new firearm or ammunition purchases.On March 9, Breitbart News reported that Gov. Scott signed a $400 million gun bill that includes orders which allows a family member or law enforcement to petition a judge to order the seizure of an individual’s firearms. The bill also put waiting periods in place for long gun purchases, raised the minimum purchase age for long gun purchases (from 18 to 21), and banned bump stocks.When asked about the confiscatory order that resulted in the seizure of the Lighthouse Point resident’s firearms, Mayor Glenn Troast said, “This is not about the Second Amendment and it’s not about the NRA. We need commonsense gun laws and this is a commonsense gun law that gives police officers new tools they need to help us protect our community.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

4,"After all, Everytown’s gun control theme for the day is #WearOrange.The actors, actresses, and other celebrities do not espouse any particular way to prevent or control gun crime, but many of them do share the exaggerated claim that “93 Americans are killed” by “gun violence” each day.Longtime gun control proponents Julianne Moore and Amy Schumer each tweeted the “93 victims” claim: Tyrone Lawson, 17, was shot and killed leaving a college basketball game in Chicago in 2013. I #WearOrange for Tyrone along with the 93 people who are killed, and the hundreds who are injured by gun violence every day in the United States.A post shared by Julianne Moore (@juliannemoore) on Jun 2, 2017 at 5:24am PDTI #WearOrange for Ronique Williams. One of the 93 killed, and hundreds injured by gun violence every day in America.— Amy Schumer (@amyschumer) June 2, 2017During the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton made similar claims — Clinton claimed 90 people killed a day — for a total of “33,000 people a year.”Breitbart News has repeatedly pointed out that this figure actually swells the number of people killed via “gun violence” by 66 percent. In reality, the number of people killed via actual “gun violence” ranges from about 10,500 to 12,000 a year. Clinton swelled that number by adding in firearm-related suicides, which number roughly 20,000 to 22,000 per year. Everytown, Moore, and Schumer have done the same thing to swell their figures.Of course, there were many celebrities who did not bother trying to quantify “gun violence.” Rather, they simply took a selfie to show that they voiced opposition to it and demanded that it be stopped. They did not put forth any plans for stopping gun crime in the Democrat-controlled cities where it thrives — cities like Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, St. Louis, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and Seattle — but they did post photos of themselves:#WearOrange pic.twitter.com/17qp8QksAB— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 2, 2017#WearOrange today!

5,"Mensa was arrested in Beverly Hills after being found with a concealed handgun without a California concealed carry license.On March 7, 2017, TMZ reported, “[Mensa] was stopped in Beverly Hills … for running a stop sign and having tinted windows … according to law enforcement sources. We’re told he informed cops he had a gun in his car and showed them his concealed carry permit. The problem is … cops say the permit is for another state.”Mensa faced “felony” charges for the incident but was able to plead down to “two years probation.”In addition to performing Saturday, Mensa called out another rapper, Killer Mike, for criticizing march participants who blindly follow the “progressive movement.” Killer Mike warned that gun control ultimately means blacks lose the guns with which they protect their freedom. Mensa responded by challenging him to a debate:To @KillerMike : YOU DONT NEED AN AR-15. As a black man & fellow gun owner I would like to have a debate with you about your stances on gun-control.— vino valentino (@VicMensa) March 24, 2018Killer Mike responded by saying, “We got the same publicist and u have my phone number.

6,"The murders are in line with what the city has witnessed over the past few years. ABC7 reports there were seven murders over the Memorial Day Weekend in 2017 and eight during the same weekend in 2016.Chicago’s overall murder rate is slightly lower than it was last year at this point. USA Today reports there have been 191 murders year-to-date, whereas there were 237 murders at this same time last year. However, the murder rate is still high enough that it puts Chicago “on pace once again to record more homicides than any other American city. ”In fact, “Chicago still has tallied nearly as many homicides thus far in 2018 as New York City (106) and Los Angeles (92) combined.”This violence is occurring in a city where gun control has been the go-to solution for crime for decades. The city banned handgun ownership in 1982, only to see the murder rate skyrocket. The Chicago Police Department reported there were 850 homicides in 1993, 930 homicides in 1994, 921 homicides in 1991, and a startling 940 homicides in 1992. Yet the city’s leaders refused to lift the handgun ban, doing so only when the ban was struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2010.Even now, city and state leaders push for more gun control as the solution to the violence in Chicago. On March 8, 2018, Breitbart News reported that the Illinois House passed a bill designed to require 18-20-year olds to hand over theretofore legally purchased and possessed “assault weapons.” More recently, on April 3, 2018, Breitbart News reported that the Chicago suburb of Deerfield actually empowered their chief of police to confiscate residents’ “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazines and destroy them.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

7,"The bill was also signed by Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Dean Heller (R-NV).Fox News Congressional reporter Chad Pergram tweeted that the bill is designed to “strengthen the background check system” in the wake of the Texas church attack.The Texas church attacker passed a background check for his gun, although he had a conviction that should have prevented gun possession. He received his conviction via a court-martial while in the Air Force but NPR reported that the Air Force “mishandled” the matter by failing to report it to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS), which is the system through which background checks are conducted.The Air Force investigation into where and how the breakdown on information reporting occurred is still underway. In the meantime, Sens. Cornyn, Murphy, Feinstein, Blumenthal, Shaheen, Hatch, and Heller are pushing for a new law.Murphy is ecstatic. He tweeted that the legislation is the most significant gun law promoted since Sen.

8,"These controls range from an all-out ban on semiautomatic firearms to regulations on single shot muzzleloaders and limits on the number of guns someone can pass to a felon.Breitbart News outlined the first nine of these gun controls on October 11. They were:Numerous others have flooded in since the introduction of those original nine. The newest suggested controls include regulation on single shot muzzleloaders. In fact, Gabby Giffords gun control group suggests muzzleloaders could be the next bump stock. Her group also wants gun control on “high capacity shotguns,” binary triggers, “AK and AR style pistols,” arm braces for AR style pistols, “AR pistol blade stabilizers,” .50 caliber rifles, .50 caliber ammunition, and tracer rounds for various calibers of firearms.Giffords’ group seeks to substantiate their call for a ban on tracer rounds by writing, “Tracer rounds allow a shooter to see where rounds are tracking at night.”Two other gun controls are being pushed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The first of the two is a federal ban on firearms trafficking. She is pushing this ban although such trafficking is already clearly prohibited via ATF background check form 4473. LIBN reports that Gillibrand is also again pushing the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking & Crime Prevention Act, which “would make it illegal to sell purchase, or transfer two or more firearms to someone whom the seller knows, or has reasonable cause to know, is a felon or convicted domestic abuser.”Lastly, the 21st gun control currently being pushed is regulation on so-called “ghost guns.” These are guns that are legal to manufacture at home, but require a significant amount of know-how and equipment to accomplish. The establishment media is currently pointed to two crimes committed with “ghost guns” as justification for a new federal law to regulate the sale, manufacture of the firearms.On October 19, 2017, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urged his Democrat colleagues to drop gun control. He worried that it will politically hurtful for those trying to get re-elected in red states in November 2018.

9,"They run this risk via their in-your-face gun control hubris, especially when that hubris is directed toward docile actors.For example, on Monday Rep. Steve King (R-IA) addressed Parkland students who want to raise the minimum age for gun purchases by asking, “If you are a teenager & believe you won’t be responsible enough to own a gun until 21, why should you vote before 21?” That is a reasonable question when one considers that voting and owning guns are both constitutional rights. Yet the responses to his question varied between things  too vulgar to print and pronouncements that his political career is over–that he is a pawn of the NRA and is going to be voted out office.Or consider David Hogg, one of the most frequent spokesmen for Parkland gun control activists. He put out a PSA one week before the student march for gun control and asked, “What if our politicians weren’t the bitch of the NRA?” And it is not just the way he talks about the NRA, although that runs the risk of motivating the group’s five million-plus members to show up and vote. It is also the way he appears to set himself apart from other Americans in general.Take his March 22 Axios interview as an example. In that interview he talked of how his teachers are “very understanding” when he has to skip school for gun control events and appearances. He even talked of how he was recently supposed to take a math test but just said, “Nah.” This gives the appearance of special rules for the philosopher king, rules and opportunities that cannot be enjoyed by others. One cannot be blamed for sensing a similar, conflicting set of rules in gun controllers from Hollywood and D.C.If, by chance, you still do not see the hubris, then look at Parkland gun control activist Cameron Kasky, who spends time rejecting the idea of arming teachers to defend students when he is not making fun of Americans’ abiding conviction that we need to be armed to repel a tyranny. On Tuesday he tweeted:To all people who think they need an assault rifle: I can not promise this, but I truly do not believe the redcoats will be coming for any of us any time soon.— Cameron Kasky (@cameron_kasky) March 28, 2018And we have not even mentioned how the gun control activists treated Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch during the CNN gun control town hall.It was just a few short months ago–October 19, 2017, to be exact–that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was urging his colleagues to drop gun control until after the November 2018 election. He worried that the incessant, post-Vegas gun control push was going to hurt Democrats in the midterm elections.Yet the gun control push from Democrats has only escalated since Schumer voiced his concerns, thanks to the Parkland activists and others.Meanwhile, the NRA PAC took in February donations that were three times higher than it received during January. This could mean that people had spent months saving in a coordinated effort to give money to the NRA in February or…it could mean that Schumer was right and all the gun control rhetoric is rallying Americans to the standard once more. And that standard is the Second Amendment.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

10,"On December 22, 2017, Breitbart News reported that the ATF was taking comment on their intention to change the definition of “machinegun” so as to include a firearm that is not a “machinegun” as well. This would allow them to use the National Firearms Act (1934) to regulate machineguns and non-machineguns in the same way, which would allow them to treat simple firearm accessories and actual firearm conversion devices the same.Currently, bump stocks are not regulated because Barack Obama’s ATF evaluated them and noted that they do not convert the action of a semiautomatic into that of an automatic. Even with a bump stock, a semiautomatic rifle only fires one round per each pull of the trigger. The ATF seeks to circumvent this fact by changing the definition of words, thereby allowing itself to regulate conversion devices and non-conversion devices alike.The ATF took public comment on this backdoor bump stock gun control through January 25, 2018, and The Trace, a gun control journalism outlet, reports that 85 percent of respondents opposed the proposed controls.The Trace examined 32,000 of the comments and found that only 13 percent favored the regulatory gun control. They noted that Gun Owners of America was the predominant gun rights organization fighting against the backdoor gun control, while Gabby Giffords’s gun control group was central in the unsuccessful effort to stir up support for a bump stock ban.On January 11, 2018, Breitbart News reported Gun Owners of America’s warnings that an ATF ban on bump stocks prove insidious, expanding as needed to cover over gun controls desired by the ruling class. Former ATF gun tech chief Rick Vasquez echoed GOA’s warnings, explaining that terms that are redefined for the purposes of a bump stock ban can easily be applied to cover bans on other firearm accessories.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

12,"Speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room Sunday afternoon, Obama reminded them that law enforcement officials still didn’t know all the facts of the case and would follow the facts of the investigation to identify the motive.“What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred,” Obama said. “Over the coming days, we’ll uncover how and why this happens and we’ll go wherever the facts lead us.”But Obama ignored the connection to radical Islamic terrorism, even after news outlets reported that the shooter made a call to a Florida 911 center to pledge allegiance to ISIS.Instead, Obama echoed the calls for more gun control from anti-gun activists, reminding Americans how easy it is for criminals to get guns.“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well,” he said, calling the attack “the most deadly shooting in American history.” The president reached out the LGBT community, pointing out that they were the object of hate.“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance, sing and live,” Obama said.He described the nightclub as a place of “solidarity and empowerment” for the LGBT community to “speak their minds and advocate for their civil rights.”“This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,” he said.",0

15,"The town halls are being assembled by professional progressive activists, with primary participation from Indivisible, a radical organization that describes itself as a “progressive grassroots network of local groups” seeking to “resist the Trump Agenda.”The town halls are also being organized by a group calling itself the Town Hall Project, which is assisting the organizers of the March for Our Lives movement to stage the town hall forums nationwide.The Town Hall Project is led by professional organizers. It gained notoriety when it organized activists last year to support progressive healthcare legislation.Hogg and the March for Our Lives organizers are seeking to channel the energy of anti-gun protesters into town halls for every member of Congress during the current recess that ends April 9, promoting the campaign on Twitter as #TownHallForOurLives.Vox.com reported on the town hall plan:Congress is on recess through April 8 (April 9 for the House), so some lawmakers already have town halls scheduled. March for Our Lives and the Town Hall Project are encouraging gun control activists to rally around those already established events — or pressure representatives without a town hall scheduled to host one next week.David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and one of the March for Our Lives organizers, said this goes for Republican and Democratic Congress members — they want all 435 representatives to participate. If not, primary and general elections opponents will be invited to attend in their places, or activists will consider holding an “empty chair town hall” to call attention to their absence. “We’re not for Democrats or Republicans,” Hogg said. “We’re simply trying to save kids.”According to Hogg, more than 100 town halls have been scheduled. Hogg said he hopes activists hold politicians accountable for accepting money from the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby, though he encouraged all constituents to attend — not just advocates of gun control, but those who have opinions about school safety or mental health policy.The Town Hall Project, Hogg and Indivisible each have issued calls for the nationwide forums with lawmakers during the current recess, with Hogg pointing activists to the Town Hall Project:How to Organize a TOWN HALL FOR OUR LIVES https://t.co/uUwK5LF0Lz https://t.co/aWhVvcdpng— Town Hall Project (@townhallproject) March 26, 2018Who's ready? #THFOL https://t.co/ZZ2fk9rbqs— David Hogg (@davidhogg111) April 2, 2018Update:51 members of Congress holding town halls this recess.22 fully confirmed THFOL events on the site and over 300 organizers in 144 districts working to secure others.

He is also an award-winning independent filmmaker.Juliana Amin – National Organizing Director – Before Town Hall Project, Juliana built organizing programs across the country over multiple cycles. Most recently she oversaw a team of more than 60 staff in Ohio for the Clinton campaign in 2016.The Town Hall Project website links to only two outside resource kits for assistance on how to organize. One of those kits is the “Town Hall strategy resources” from the Indivisible Movement. The other is the “Recess Toolkit” published by the Center for American Progress (CAP).Last year, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders have been professional activists openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.Also last year, Organizing for Action (OFA), the activist group that morphed from Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, partnered with the Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest Trump’s agenda.OFA is also promoting Hogg’s town hall campaign:REMINDER: Congressional recess is happening right now. Our reps and senators *should* be holding town halls/listening sessions/office hours. Check https://t.co/LTlXOo9MLH and follow @townhallproject for updates, and show up!— OFA (@OFA) March 30, 2018Both the House and Senate are on recess for the next two weeks. That means your elected officials should be holding town halls to hear directly from you on the issues you care about. Follow @townhallproject and visit https://t.co/LTlXOo9MLH to find an event near you.— OFA (@OFA) March 26, 2018Indivisible’s DC branch was implicated last February in a scuffle that reportedly injured a 71-year-old staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) as well as reportedly knocking a two-year-old to the ground. Indivisible protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine’s Day cards.CAP, meanwhile, was co-founded by John Podesta, who served as Bill Clinton’s chief of staff and was co-director of Obama’s White House transition team in 2009. Podesta served as chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.The CAP is financed in significant part by Soros. When it was first founded in 2003, Soros pledged up to $3 million for the group. The billionaire has since provided numerous annual grants to CAP, including a $400,000 grant in 2013 for the CAP’s campus activism wing, a $350,000 grant in 2012 to their legal action arm and numerous other grants. CAP has also received near-annual grants from the Soros-funded Tides Foundation.The Town Hall Project says it is supported by “hundreds of grassroots donors” and lists only one “partner” by name, the NextGen America organization.On the main page of its official website, NextGen America calls for “resistance” in the progressive battle for environmental activism as well as “the fight for immigrant rights, affordable health care and core American values.”NextGen America was founded by Democratic mega donor Tom Steyer.Town Hall Project Managing Director Nathan Williams has described his group’s mission thusly: “It’s safe to say most of our team are motivated by a desire to fight the Trump agenda.”Williams told McClatchy last week that the aim is to hold 535 town halls over Congressional recess. “This is not an unreasonable thing to expect. If they can meet with donors every recess they can take an hour to talk to constituents – it is called ‘district work period,’” said Williams. “But yes, it’s safe to say that not all 535 will host town halls over recess. There will probably be mostly empty chair town halls on the seventh.”McClatchy further reported:Williams said they’ve gotten calls from more than 300 potential organizers from about 130 districts on hosting town halls on April 7. If the member of Congress refuses to show up, they’ll have an “empty chair” town hall, inviting members’ campaign opponents and hosting constituents to voice their concerns. So far, 48 members of Congress have in-person town halls scheduled over the recess, and about a third of them are Republicans.More than a dozen such empty chair town halls were officially organized by Thursday, including ones for Reps. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Ken Buck, R-Colo., Ron Estes, R-Kan., Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.…But March for Our Lives organizers, coming off a weekend that saw hundreds of thousands of people participate in rallies for gun control reform across the nation, aren’t giving up. Williams said Town Hall Project reached out a week before the march to offer its help and floated the idea that this march happening before a recess was a great time to demand town halls. The Parkland students have been pushing people over social media to organize town halls since Sunday.Last year, following a violent scuffle at an event with Rohrabacher, Republican lawmakers expressed concern for their safety at town hall events. The concern came amid calls for stepped-up activism at town halls from a coalition of professional activist groups, especially the Town Hall Project, the Soros-funded MoveOn.org, and Democracy for America.  The “storm-the-town halls” strategy reportedly resulted in Republican town halls being swamped by activists.The disruptions prompted Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and other Republican lawmakers last year to opt for the safety of telephone conference calls instead of in-person town halls, with Gohmert explaining he would hold the phone sessions “until the threat of violence at town hall meetings recedes.”“Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety,” Gohmert wrote in a letter to his constituents at the time.Rohrabacher criticized the Indivisible protesters who stormed his event last year as “part of a nationwide, anti-Trump mobilization” that is “engaged in political thuggery, pure and simple.”While Hogg openly pushes the town halls along with a coalition of left-wing groups, he appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday to deny that any “shadowy figures” are behind his gun-control activism.He was replying to a charge from Bill O’Reilly linking Hogg’s efforts to get advertisers to boycott Laura Ingraham’s television show to the Media Matters activist group.“I’m pretty well lit — I don’t see any shadowy figures behind me,” Hogg stated. “I mean, honestly, if he sees shadowy figures as corporate America standing by us, OK, I guess. It doesn’t really make sense.”O’Reilly made the charge following an article by this reporter documenting that the Soros-funded Media Matters has been helping to fuel Hogg’s advertising boycott targeting Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show.The “Ingraham Angle” host last week tweeted a Daily Wire story titled “Gun Rights Provocateur David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied.” Ingraham adder her own comment: “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it.”Ingraham apologized for her remarks, yet Hogg has persisted with the boycott campaign.Hogg sprung to action immediately following Ingraham’s remarks, tweeting a list of Ingraham’s top 12 advertisers and promoting the hashtag #BoycottIngramAdverts.Pick a number 1-12 contact the company next to that # Top Laura Ingraham Advertisers1. @sleepnumber 2. @ATT 3.

In the videos, Paul sets fire to a mattress in his backyard pool, frequently uses the n-word when freestyle rapping and ruining expensive Lamborghinis. Paul made headlines last year when a news crew interviewed neighbors in the area surrounding Paul’s house. “The neighbors hate me,” Paul told a KTLA film crew that arrived at his property. When the KTLA reporter further questions Paul about the antics surrounding his home and the neighbor’s complaints Paul replies, “Yeah, it is like that.” Paul responded to the claim that the neighborhood is now “like a circus” by saying, “But, I mean, people like going to circuses.”Neighbor Maytal Dahan told KTLA  “It used to be a really nice, quiet street and now [it’s] just this, like, war zone. We’re families here and we’re more than happy to have them live here if they’re respectful of their neighbors, but they’re not.” Paul’s neighbors plan to hold a meeting with city officials next week to consider whether or not to file a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Paul and the homeowner that rents the property to Paul and his “crew.” When asked for comment on what the neighbors are experiencing Paul said, “It’s terrible, it’s a bad situation and I feel bad for them, but there’s nothing we can do.

17,"Thursday, Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson responded to calls from the left for gun control in the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting in Parkland, FL.The “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host theorized some Democratic politicians and “blustery charlatans in the media” had much darker aims with their calls for gun control, which he argued had little to do with public safety.“Let’s stop lying about this,” he said. “The calls we are hearing today for gun control have nothing to do with protecting Americans from violence. What you’re witnessing is a kind of class war. The left hates rural America, red America, gun-owning America, the America that elected Donald Trump. They hate them. Progressives are still in charge of most of the major institutions in this country, and they despise the autonomy of an armed population. They want collective punishment for the sins of a few. They seek to obliterate a core constitutional right rather than trying to mitigate its downsides. They call it gun control, but it’s not. It’s people control.

And I used the example of abortion.”The school district defended its decision, saying, “The teacher was not penalized or placed on leave based on her viewpoints. …The district can clarify that the action was taken due to complaints from parents and students involving the teacher’s communications regarding… the student-led remembrance activities.”Benzel was asked to come back to the school Friday but she demurred, instead deciding to take a day off and rest up to return to class next week.She observed, “I teach over 120 students and [administrators] took two students and one parent’s complaint and … took that minuscule evidence, did not corroborate it with any other students or parents and basically targeted me.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

23,"The mainstream media are celebrating the “walkout” as an authentic expression of outrage that demands a response from political leaders. But it is not, and there are at least five lies they are telling you about it. Lie #1: The “walkout” is being staged by students. (Frederic J. Brown / AFP / Getty)In most schools, especially elementary schools, the walkout is being organized by teachers, administrators, and liberal parents. Nationwide, the walkout is being coordinated by the Women’s March, an anti-Trump organization that has a soft spot for radical antisemites like Louis Farrakhan. Big media companies, especially CNN, have been publicizing the protest.Students are involved, but not in charge. Lie #2: The “walkout” is voluntary.Elementary school walkout in Alexandria, Virginia.

Look at those faces. pic.twitter.com/ThyzDtyGo5— Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) March 14, 2018Younger children cannot stay in classrooms by themselves, and they cannot opt out. Older children in some schools are reportedly allowed to stay behind, but many will be less likely to do so given pressure from adults and peers.Somehow, the liberals who argue against prayer in public schools — even a generic “moment of silence” —  because of fears of religious coercion are creating a coercive political environment. Lie #3: The “walkout” is not about gun control.(Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty)Organizers are pulling a sly bait-and-switch. At my daughter’s school, for example, staff and the PTA organized a “peace and kindness assembly.” The principal told parents, via e-mail: “There will be NO mention of school shootings, guns, or violence of any kind.” But the PTA said: “Schools across the country and state are supporting their students as they show their support for greater gun control.”They minimize objections by selling “peace” to parents, then maximize impact by pushing “gun control” in the media. Lie #4: The “walkout” is non-partisan.(Frederic J. Brown / AFP / Getty)The groups involved in organizing the walkout are all left-wing and Democrat-aligned.Few, if any, schools are bothering to provide an alternative point of view about the importance of the Second Amendment, or about arming qualified teachers and staff to intercept and deter possible attackers. Lie #5: If you oppose the “walkout,” you support violence against children.(Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty)This is the most pernicious lie of all, and real message of the protests. The goal of the “walkout” — aside from mobilizing Democrats against gun-clinging Republicans in a midterm election year — is to shame Second Amendment supporters into silence and conformity.It amounts to exploiting our children, as well as those 17 deaths in Florida, for political purposes.Joel B.

They put the turnout at just over 200,000, which was 300,000 less than expected.Moreover, the Washington Post reported that only “10 percent” of those who attended the march were actually people under the age of 18. In other words, it shifted from being a student march to being another event co-opted by protesters of all ages, many of whom were ready and willing to call for the abolition of the Second Amendment.Cook’s claim about an “epidemic of gun violence” is also questionable. After all, the gun crime in our country occurs in cities like Chicago, Baltimore, St. Louis, New Orleans, etc., all of which have one thing in common — Democratic leaders who continually push gun control as the solution for the failure of gun control.To be fair, Americans have been rallying to a cause since Parkland. But that cause has often proven to be a defense of gun rights rather than an insistence on new gun controls.For example, gifts to the NRA’s PAC tripled in February, compared to January, while celebrities, student gun control activists, and the establishment media were calling for more gun laws. Then, in March, the NRA’s Political Victory Fund broke a 15-year record by taking in nearly $2.5 million in donations.Also in March, background checks for gun sales set a record for most background checks for any March in history. Background checks for gun sales in April set a record for most background checks for any April in history.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

25,"The Smithsonian article opens by challenging a romanticized view of the Wild West, positing instead an image of cattle down after cattle town where firearms were heavily regulated.It presents Tombstone as a case in point and set the background for readers:Marshall Virgil Earp, having deputized his brothers Wyatt and Morgan and his pal Doc Holliday, is having a gun control problem. Long-running tensions between the lawmen and a faction of cowboys – represented this morning by Billy Claiborne, the Clanton brothers, and the McLaury brothers—will come to a head over Tombstone’s gun law.The laws of Tombstone at the time required visitors, upon entering town to disarm, either at a hotel or a lawman’s office. (Residents of many famed cattle towns, such as Dodge City, Abilene, and Deadwood, had similar restrictions.) But these cowboys had no intention of doing so as they strolled around town with Colt revolvers and Winchester rifles in plain sight. Earlier on this fateful day, Virgil had disarmed one cowboy forcefully, while Wyatt confronted another and county sheriff Johnny Behan failed to persuade two more to turn in their firearms.Next, Smithsonian explains that the gunfight at the OK Corral was a result of the Earp brothers seeking to disarm Claiborne, the Clanton brothers, and the McLaury brothers. They told the story as way to highlight Tombstone’s requirement to disarm but completely missed the fact that the impotence of the demand was evidenced in the cowboys’ refusal to do so.In other words, while Smithsonian seized on Tombstone’s requirement to disarm as paramount, they overlooked the greater point. Namely, that criminals had no interest in cooperating with it.Sound familiar? It should. After all, the violence in gun-controlled Chicago surged to such a level that it skewed national murder numbers in 2016. Chicago had a complete ban on handguns from 1982 to 2010, they have a violence tax, county restrictions on the number of federal licensed gun stores allowed, and, like the rest of Illinois, requirements that residents get a Firearms Owners Identification (FOID) card before being allowed to own a gun. The FOID card does not allow residents to carry a gun for self-defense, they have to jump through another hoop and get a concealed carry permit to do that.The point is simple—the vestiges of gun control are alive and well in Chicago yet violence rages. Just as we saw in Tombstone, criminals in Chicago do not place compliance with gun laws at the top of their daily to-do list.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

26,"On March 4 Breitbart News reported on Gabby Giffords’ renewed push to extend background checks to gun shows so that everyone has to pass the same background check her attacker passed. Media outlets and gun control proponents went apoplectic, exposing the fact that they had assumed Giffords would be able to push background checks as a solution to “violence” without her claims being scrutinized.In other words, Giffords is their human shield — the gun control representative who could do and say what she wanted without facing any real pressure to prove her claims were true.But BN showed that her claims that background checks are a way of “stopping violence” can’t even survive Giffords’ personal experience. After all, her attacker, Jared Loughner, passed a background check to acquire the gun with which he attacked her in January 2011.After BN reported this, the NRA tweeted the story and media and gun controllers lost it. Slate, MSNBC, Daily Mail, Huffington Post UK, Tucson Weekly, Mother Jones, Blue Nation Review, Daily Kos, Chicago Sun Times, The Hill, New York Daily News, San Francisco Sentinel, Inquistr, and others were aghast that Breitbart News actually tested Giffords’ claims.But no one displayed the conviction that Giffords’ views were above criticism quite as well as MSNBC’s Al Sharpton. On March 6 he asked: “How can the NRA tweet anything like this about Giffords after all that she went through?”In other words, Giffords is their human shield.Gun control proponents know background checks don’t stop high profile gun-related crimes — just as they didn’t stop Jerad and Amanda Miller (Las Vegas), Elliot Rodger (Santa Barbara), Ivan Lopez (Fort Hood 2009), Aaron Alexis (DC Navy Yard), James Holmes (Aurora theater), Nidal Hasan (Fort Hood 2009), and numerous other high profile attackers who passed background checks to acquire their guns. Yet background checks continue to be pushed because they represent another way to control law-abiding gun owners.Giffords was supposed to stand with Democrats and push for their passage as one whose ideas could not be criticized, mush less assailed.Here’s the problem — background checks don’t work, and Giffords’ attacker is living proof of that.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

27,"With strict gun control in place, Londoners are simply being stabbed to death. The Times describes “a dramatic surge in knife crime.”On September 24, 2014, Breitbart News reported that gun control had made Britain extremely violent. That gun control was put in place during the 20th century via a relentless, incremental push, which began with laws similar to firearm owner identification cards and background checks and ended with a virtual ban on all handguns.This is how gun control was implemented:Britain began placing restrictions on gun ownership after World War I with the Firearms Act of 1920. The passage of this act was emotionally driven, based in part on the public’s war-weariness and in part on the fear that an increased number of guns–guns from the battle field–would increase crime.The Firearms Act of 1920 did not ban guns. Rather, it required that citizens who wanted a gun had to first obtain a certificate from the government. We see this same stage taking place in various places in the United States now, where a person who wants a firearm has to get a Fire Owner Identification Card (Illinois) or has to be vetted by police (Massachusetts) or both.Thirteen years after the passage of the Firearms Act, British Parliament passed the Firearms and Imitation Firearms Bill, making the possession of a replica gun or a real one equally punishable unless the owner of either could show the lawful purpose for which he had it. This was followed by the Firearms Act of 1937, which author Frank Miniter says “extended restrictions to shotguns and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual private firearm certificates.”In the U.S., police departments in Massachusetts play the role Britain’s chief constables played and have final say on who can or can’t own a firearm. On July 25, Breitbart News reported that that Massachusetts police were pressing for “sole discretion” on who could own a long gun; they already had such discretion over who could own a handgun. On August 1, they received the power they sought.Britain continued to issue firearm certificates as World War II set in. But by the time the war was over, the gun control mindset had permeated society to a point where self-defense was no longer a valid reason to secure a certificate for gun ownership.Guns were simply for sport or for hunting.In 1987, Michael Ryan shot and killed sixteen people in Hungerford, including his mother. He wounded fourteen others, then killed himself. According to the Library of Congress, Ryan used “lawfully owned” rifles to carry out the attack. Nevertheless, his attack prompted the passage of more laws in the form of the Firearms Act of 1988. This act “banned the possession of high-powered self loading rifles” and “burst-firing weapons,” and imposed “stricter standards for ownership” to secure a government certificate to own a shotgun.In 1996, Thomas Hamilton walked into an elementary school in Dunblane, Scotland, and shot and killed “sixteen small children…and their teacher in the gym before killing himself.” He brought two rifles and four handguns to carry out the attack. All six guns were legally owned: Hamilton had fully complied with gun control statutes.The Firearm Act of 1997 was passed while emotions ran high. Gun control proponents push for an all-out ban on private gun ownership, in the much the same way that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) reacted to the heinous crime at Sandy Hook Elementary by trying to ban approximately 150 different guns.Yet the Firearm Act did not ban all guns, “but served to essentially prohibit the ownership of handguns in Britain” and to make the acquisition of certificate to possess a long gun an onerous and time-consuming one.In 2009, just 12 years after the passage of the Firearm Act, the Daily Mail described Britain as “the most violent country in Europe.” It reported that Britain had “a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S.”On October 21, 2017, Breitbart News reported that rapes in London were three times higher than in New York City:Reported rapes are running three times higher in London than in NYC https://t.co/oc60cWbDAZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 21, 2017Now, homicides in London are higher than homicides in New York City, and the man with a knife is king.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

28,"In other words, gun control is not working in New York, just as it has not worked in Chicago or Baltimore.The annual cost of “gun violence” was put forth via a study by Gabby Giffords’ gun control group and published by New York Daily News.Kelly Drane is an associate of Giffords’ gun control group and she commented on NY’s raging gun violence, saying, “The costs are massive—the human and moral costs and also the fiscal costs we share as taxpayers and society at large. New York State is actually a national leader (in gun control), but even so, the cost of gun violence, even in one of our safest states, is enormous.”Following the heinous December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School, NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) pushed through a gun control package called the SAFE Act. It contained the “assault weapons” ban, “high capacity” magazine ban, expanded background checks, registration database, and more. Cuomo signed it into law in January 2013.On March 3, 2015, Breitbart News reported that New York City witnessed a sharp increase in shootings and murders during the first two months of 2015, when compared to the first two months of 2014.  NY1 reported the increase in shootings was “20 percent” and the increase in murders was “20 percent” as well. Month’s later, on September 7, 2015, four shootings and a stabbing marred  Brooklyn’s J’Ouvert festival and Cuomo claimed the failure was not with his gun control but with a lack of gun control in southern states.Now Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a central voice in the gun control lobby, shows that Cuomo’s gun control is not working. Of course, they do not come right out and say that gun control is failing. Rather, they suggest gun control must be complimented by laws in other areas in order to work.For example, Robin Lloyd, director of government affairs for Giffords’ gun control group, said, “Part of the story we want to tell is that even with the strong gun laws (in New York), there’s still other things that can be done to address the gun violence and the impacts it has.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

29,"The latest occurred on June 14 in San Francisco, where a UPS employee pulled out a gun during “a company meeting” and opened fire, killing three innocents.Moms Demand Action was quick to post news of the incident on its Facebook page–another high-profile shooting it can use to push for more gun control. However, to be honest, the only gun controls California has yet to pass are a ban on semi-automatic guns and/or an outright ban on gun ownership.A ban on semi-automatic handguns would do nothing to slow crime, as it would only mean that criminals would have semi-automatic guns, and law-abiding citizens would not. Moreover, the Fresno gunman, who attacked in April, killed his victims with a revolver, which is more than sufficient as a murder weapon when one lives in a Democrat-run state that goes out of its way to prevent law-abiding citizens from being armed for self-defense.We realize from the Chicago example that an all-out ban on the possession of handguns of any kind correlates with even higher murders than we see in that city now. In short, bans empower criminals and terrorists while making the vulnerable more vulnerable.So despite almost every gun control imaginable, a UPS employee opened fired on colleagues during a meeting, and we now know the guns he used were stolen.According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the attacker had two guns on his person, one of which had been stolen in Utah and one in Napa, California.The Chronicle reported that although “California outlaws an array of assault weapons as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines, the weaponry frequently travels across the border.” In reporting this, the outlet overlooked that they had already announced one of the stolen guns was from Napa, and a gun stolen in Napa does not have to cross state borders before being used in a crime in San Francisco.Clearly, the UPS attack is just another shooting that shows strict gun control is not an effective means of stopping determined attackers from attacking. But it certainly guarantees their victims will not be able to shoot back.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Police said the boy was hit by a “stray bullet” that grazed his head.The 21-year-old mother, Nakia Bailey, was shot and killed Wednesday night while “standing with a group of people on the West Side’s Homan Square neighborhood.” The gunman in a silver car opened fire on her as he rode past.The shootings came after unseasonably high temperatures were accompanied by a level of weekday violence that “is usually not seen until the middle of summer.” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said, “It’s not like people sit around and say, you know, I’m gonna wait for the weather to warm up to start making acts of crime. You just have more people out.”On December 21, 2016, Breitbart News reported the murder rate in gun-controlled Chicago had gotten so high it was skewing national murder figures. The death toll in Chicago had passed 730 for the year by December 6, 2016.

It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby. #WeCallBS https://t.co/7JkbmVeRHT— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 19, 2018In her speech at a gun control rally on Saturday, Gonzalez accused President Donald Trump of being bought by the National Rifle Association (NRA). After a tearful introduction, she launched into a set of talking points familiar from gun control campaigns nationwide.CNN posted a transcript of her remarks, a portion of which follows:Every single person up here today, all these people should be home grieving. But instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see. Since the time of the Founding Fathers and since they added the Second Amendment to the Constitution, our guns have developed at a rate that leaves me dizzy. The guns have changed but our laws have not.…Because Australia had one mass shooting in 1999 in Port Arthur (and after the) massacre introduced gun safety, and it hasn’t had one since. Japan has never had a mass shooting. Canada has had three and the UK had one and they both introduced gun control and yet here we are, with websites dedicated to reporting these tragedies so that they can be formulated into statistics for your convenience.…We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He [the shooter] would not have harmed that many students with a knife.…If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.You want to know something?

32,"Citibank currently enjoys a $700 billion contract with the General Services Administration (GSA), and Rokita is seeking to have that contract terminated.Rokita sent a letter to GSA administrator Emily W. Murphy, in which he pointed to Citibank’s new policy mandating that financial customers in the firearms sector refuse to sell “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and also refuse to sell long guns to any one under 21, although federal law allows sales to customers age 18 and up.Citibank’s policy also requires customers in the firearms industry to go beyond federal requirements on background checks and refuse sales to anyone whose background check goes three days without conclusively proving the would-be buyer is barred from firearm possession.Rokita described these policies as “a flagrant attempt to undermine our fundamental rights by caving to radicals not endorsed by our federal government.” He told Administrator Murphy, “Our federal government should instead do business with companies that respect all of our constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment.”He called on GSA to “take all necessary steps to review and terminate its contract with Citibank,” unless the finance giant reverses policy.During an April 14 interview on Breitbart News Saturday, Rep. Rokita emphasized that Citibank has proven to be “a huge critic of the NRA and the Second Amendment itself.” He praised the 15 co-signatories who joined him in calling for Citibank’s federal contract to be terminated.The 15 Reps. who signed Rokita’s letter are Rick Allen (R-GA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Rep.

33,"For example, on October 16, 2015, during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton described Australia’s confiscatory approach to gun control and said that “it would be worth considering doing it on the national level” here. And on July 5, 2016, Breitbart News reported that gun-toting action star Matt Damon used the Australian premiere of Jason Bourne to praise that country’s gun controls. Stuff magazine quoted Damon saying, “You guys did it here in one fell swoop and I wish that could happen in my country, but it’s such a personal issue for people that we cannot talk about it sensibly. We just can’t.”On September 12, 2014, shoot ’em star Liam Neeson spoke to the Independent, complaining about private gun ownership in America and praising Great Britain for banning handguns.Yet here we are in 2018, with a mass shooting in Australia, a machine gun attack in London, and London stabbings at such levels that knife control is the talk of the town.On May 11, 2018, the New York Times reported on the Australian mass shooting, noting that it included four children, “aged 8 to 13.” On June 1, 2018, Breitbart News reported on London’s machine gun attack.

34,"This news comes as Trump, the NRA, and others are pressing red state Democrats to confirm Neil Gorsuch to fill the void left by Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.According to the NYT Mag, Manchin appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on December 14, 2016, the 4th anniversary of the heinous attack in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza stole guns, killed his mother, then went to Sandy Hook Elementary and killed 26 more innocents. While on air, Manchin again voiced support for his pet gun control item — an expansion of background checks in response to the Sandy Hook attack.Within an hour after his segment ended, Manchin received a phone call from Donald Trump. And while he did not divulge details of the call, he told NYT Mag reporter Robert Draper that he believes he has “a complete opportunity” to secure gun control under Trump.Draper said Manchin believes his gun control has a chance it never had under Barack Obama because “no one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.” The problem with this claim is that Manchin’s gun control — universal background checks- – cripples gun rights by coupling private sales with retail sales and forcing Americans to seek out an agent of the state for permission to conduct either kind of sale. Moreover, history — even recent history — has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that universal background checks are insidious; they lead to more and more gun control and especially to a gun registry.In fact, universal background checks cannot work without a gun registry. Think about it — how can the government be sure no guns are changing hands privately unless they know where every gun is and the name of everyone who owns it? This is exactly why the implementation of universal background checks in California has been followed by gun registration requirements. Moreover, it is why more and more gun controls that involve paperwork continue to be passed in that state; the hope is to discover guns that have not made it onto the state database of gun owners yet.The newly passed background checks for ammunition purchases is one way California is broadening the paper trail. Someone who may have a gun they got from their grandfather — a gun that has no paper trail at all — can eventually be found when he goes to buy ammunition and has to go through the background check system Californians go through for every gun sale. It is a constricting circle, and it is the very circle Manchin has been pushing for all Americans since January 2013.One more problem with Manchin’s universal background checks — they have nothing to do with the attack on Sandy Hook. As noted above, the Sandy Hook attacker stole his guns. In fact, even Manchin admitted his universal background checks would not have stopped the attack had they been in place. Manchin made this admission during the April 14, 2013, airing CBS News’s Face the Nation.Manchin is a Democrat from a pro-gun, red state that President Trump won handily. He is pushing gun control, and West Virginians need to remember he is up for re-election in 2018.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Game 3 of the series was up 26 percent over last year’s comparable playoff game.The Voice co-host and pop megastar Kelly Clarkson opened the show bucking the scheduled “moment of silence” and, instead, calling for a “moment of action” and “change” on the issues of guns in America.Pop star Shawn Mendes and rapper Khalid were joined onstage by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Show Choir who belted the song “Youth.” Khalid’s political statement came in the form of a shirt, which read “Protect Our Guns Children” with the word “Guns” crossed out.Still, despite the large viewership for the NBA, most of network TV was in the dumps on Sunday as finales mostly declined in numbers over last year’s offerings.The night’s Fox line up earned an average of .8 while the two-hour season finale of the CBS crime drama NCIS: Los Angeles pulled in a .8/3 rating, giving the season some of the worst numbers the series has seen. CBS’ 10 PM offering, the political drama Madame Secretary, remained flat over last week with a .6/3 rating, though its finale lost over last year’s numbers.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.",0
37,"Will other pro-gun control Hollywood actors and directors who’ve used firearms in films for years pledge to lay down their guns in future films?It’s a question that could be asked of the likes of legendary director Steven Spielberg, whose has written, directed, or produced dozens of movies and TV series that have featured the use of guns.George Clooney pledged to give $500,000 to a gun control march but his career is littered with film roles (at lease a dozen) in which his characters wielded a gun. Will he now pledged to leave guns out of his future projects?The same question can be asked of actors Jim Carrey, Mark Ruffalo, and Matt Damon, who have all portrayed gun-wielding characters in popular movies but have also advocated for the enactment of more gun laws — reforms that will invariably make it harder for law-abiding citizens to purchase or sell firearms.Below is a list of Hollywood stars and preeminent filmmakers who used guns on screen while calling for more gun control.Jim Carrey has spent years making films with characters using guns. But in 2013, Carrey called defenders of the Second Amendment “heartless motherfuckers.” Recently, he has pushed for gun control by sharing original artwork with his 17 million Twitter followers.Actor Jim Carrey in Kick-Ass 2. (2013, Universal Pictures)George Clooney has starred in at least 10 films, from The Peacemaker to Ocean’s Eleven to Monuments Men, that saw his character use a gun. But the veteran star is now a vocal advocate for gun control, donating $500,000 to the upcoming student march for gun control, March for Our Lives.George Clooney in The American (2010, Universal Studios)Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence has starred in several films featuring her character using firearms — including Winter’s Bone, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and Joy — but has praised the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student pushing for gun control and said gun violence in America has nothing to do with the entertainment industry.Jennifer Lawrence as Joy Mangano in Joy (2015, Fox 2000 Pictures)Samuel L. Jackson has spent 30 years wielding guns onscreen in more than 35 films. While the Avengers star has long-advocated for the Second Amendment, he called President Donald Trump a “muthefucka” and mocked his proposal to arm teachers; a proposal that nearly half the country believes is a good idea.Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction (1994, Miramax)Emma Stone was among the many celebrities urging Americans to “reject the NRA” in the wake of the Las Vegas mass shooting last October.Emma Stone in Zombieland (2009, Columbia Pictures)Director Steven Spielberg has written, directed, or produced more than 60 movies and TV series that have featured the use of guns. But Spielberg, following George Clooney’s lead, is now among the many stars to donate $500,000 to the upcoming student march for gun control, March for Our Lives.Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images/Twentieth Century FoxMatt Damon may be best known around the world for his iconic role as gun-wielding CIA agent Jason Bourne but the star has spent years railing against Americans’ right to own guns. Damon praised Australia’s gun ban in 2016 for how it was implemented in “one fell swoop” and said, “I wish that could happen in my country, but it’s such a personal issue for people that we cannot talk about it sensibly.”Matt Damon in Jason Bourne (2016, Captivate Entertainment)Actress Jessica Chastain’s 2016 gun control film Miss Sloane bombed at the box office but that didn’t stop her from tweeting last October in a now-deleted tweet, “Welcome to America where you’ll wait 6 months for an X-Ray but hey, you can buy an AR-15 in 5 minutes flat.”Jessica Chastain in Blackbeard (2006, Larry Levinson Productions) Actress Elizabeth Banks called for gun control in December 2015 after the deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.

None of which is excessive.”Elizabeth Banks and Michael Rooker in Slither (2006, Gold Circle Films) Actor Alec Baldwin called for a national registry of all gun owners in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting. “You are more likely to use a car or emergency vehicle in saving a life. We license/register those cars and their drivers. More likely to need a prescription. We license those who distribute such drugs. We license doctors. Electricians. Lawyers. It’s time to register all guns,” Baldwin wrote on Twitter.Alec Baldwin in The Edge. (1997, Art Linson Productions).Pop superstar Lady Gaga said after last year’s deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas Lady Gaga that “blood is on the hands of” Congress and President Donald Trump if they don’t unite and enact gun control legislation.

Blatt Productions)Michael Keaton has been pushing for gun control for years. The Batman actor signed a letter in 2016 intended to urge Congress to vote on former President Barack Obama’s gun control proposal. Earlier this month, Keaton called Republicans and National Rifle Association members “weak, disgusting cowards.”Michael Keaton in American Assassin (2017, CBS Films)Julianne Moore said in 2016 that gun control “is not a Second Amendment issue! It does not deserve to be hotly debated as such! It is a safety issue!” In October, Moore said she believes there should be “limitations on the amount of firearms you can own” and urged her fans to joined the upcoming march for gun control.Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling fires a Glock 17 in Hannibal (2001, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer).Don Cheadle is a gun owner and has starred in films wielding guns since the 80s but has spent years pushing for more gun control laws. The Avengers star was among the litany of celebrities to join gun control group Everytown’s 2015 push for more gun laws.Don Cheadle star in Overture FilmsÕ TRAITOR.Actress Sharon Stone called Parkland, Florida, student activist for gun control Emma Gonzalez a “hero” and called for #GunReformNow. Sharon Stone in The Quick and the Dead (1995,TriStar Pictures)Mark Ruffalo joined celebrities calling for gun control by mocking those praying for the victims after the deadly Parkland, Florida, shooting tweeting, “Prayers without accordant action are silent lies told to oneself, heard by no God, amounting to nothing. Action is the language of truth, the prayers of the Saints.”Mark Ruffalo in Now You See Me (2013, Summit Entertainment)Actor Jeffrey Wright has been a very vocal supporter of gun control, tweeting last week: “Start to talk abolishing the 2nd amendment entirely, then maybe the gun fetishizers will want to compromise.” He called for more gun control mere hours after the Parkland, Florida shooting.Jeffrey Wright as Bernard Lowe in Westworld (2016, HBO)Actor Ron Perlman is both vocal and vile in his support for gun control. The Sons of Anarchy star tweeted and mocked those praying for the victims of last year’s Vegas mass shooting, , “We are rushing to our own funerals. We are eager to blow ourselves up. We are doing all this to ourselves. Think and pray on that!” While Perlman is calling for more gun control almost daily in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting, he’s used guns on screen for years.Ron Perlman in Sons of Anarchy (2008, FX)An outspoken supporter of gun control, Debra Messing has joined celebrities calling for a March 1 boycott of the NRA, writing on Twitter: “Since Parkland, 20 corporations have severed their ties to the NRA. @Amazon, @Apple, and @FedEx have not.

After the suicide of his nephew in 2016, Arnold wrote that “there are people in this country who consider guns to be living, breathing things. They represent liberty to some people, and the Constitution itself. Some even equate guns to religion. A gift to Americans directly from God himself. That sounds crazy to me. It should be on the gun test: If you truly believe your metal tool/explosive device is a gift from above, then you should be deemed insane and unfit to legally own a gun.”Tom Arnold in Hawaii Five-0 (2010, CBS)Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0
38,"For those too young to remember, the “rope-a-dope” was a tactic invented and used by Muhammad Ali. It was a way he made his opponents believe he had no fight left in him so that they, in return, would punch wildly and wear themselves out.Ali would back up against the ropes, put up his guard, and let his opponent land blow after blow after blow. The opponent, in return, would grow confident of victory and risk recklessness. The unacquainted sports fan would watch in disbelief as the great Ali appeared close to going down while the seasoned Ali fan eagerly awaited the moment when Ali would drop the charade and beat his opponent into submission.The moment would come at the height of the opponent’s confidence, which happened to coincide with the point where the opponent had spent his energy punching an Ali who really was not that tired after all. Ali would then grin, start punching again, and win the match.A better analogy for what President Trump may be doing to Democrats right now is hard to imagine.After all, he campaigned against expanding background checks, yet he showed interest in Sen Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) background check gun controls and asked Manchin to put them forward.Trump also campaigned against an “assault weapons” ban, yet he asked Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to add her “assault weapons” ban to Manchin’s gun control bill.Furthermore, Trump spoke in favor of national reciprocity on the campaign trail, stressing his conviction that “concealed carry [is] a right, not a privilege,” yet he rejected Rep. Steve Scalise’s (R-LA) attempt to add national reciprocity to the other gun bills being discussed in the wake of the Florida school shooting.The totality of it all makes Trump look like he is on the ropes and nearly finished fighting for the Second Amendment.But we must ask ourselves: is Trump really done fighting, or is he just sucking in the Democrats, letting them grow overconfident of victory before unleashing a flurry that stops their gun-grabbing plan in its tracks?Gun control “rope-a-dope.”AWR Hawkins is an award winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for the Breitbart News.  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Tap peoples emotion. Make it simple assault weapons.”Duncan responded immediately, “Yup- thanks.”“When I did brady bill and assault weapons for clinton we always made it simple.  Criminals or war weapons,” Emanuel said in the email to Duncan.“Gun show loophole?” Duncan responded.  “Database?  Cop-killer bullets? Too complicated?” he said.“Cop killer maybe,” Emanuel responded.  “The other no.”The exchange ended when Duncan concluded with, “Got it.”The thread shows Duncan making sure the gun control push was streamlined and fashioned to appeal to Americans at a time when hearts were broken over the heinous crimes that occurred at Sandy Hook. It completely overlooked the fact that Connecticut was had the 5th most stringent gun controls in the country at the time of the attack, that the guns the attacker used were stolen, and that the attack occurred in a gun-free zone.Emanuel put it best when he said, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

40,"Kirschermann was trying to comply with the June 30, 2018, deadline to register all “assault weapons” in the state and became snared by the flurry of laws instituted by CA Democrats over the past few years.KGET reports that Kischermann tried to register a firearm online and that firearm allegedly turned out to be “illegally modified” in light of recent laws. As a result, his home in Northwest Bakersfield was raided and “a dozen guns, 230 rounds of ammunition and two silencers [were] seized.”Kischermann was arraigned on 12 charges at the state level and released on $150,000 bond.The NRA-ILA observes:Many gun owners are already reluctant to comply with registration laws, as such schemes are quite accurately viewed as a means to facilitate firearms confiscation. Moreover, Kirschenmann isn’t alone in his alleged failure to conform to Sacramento’s mandates. As history shows, when faced with California’s increasingly onerous and byzantine gun laws, many decent folks have unwittingly broken the law, ignored new restrictions, or opted for civil disobedience.KGET quoted Retired Kern County Sheriff’s Office commander Joe Pilkington saying, “Just in the last few years, there have been lots of changes in gun laws. Making an effort, a good faith effort to comply with these really complicated laws, should count for something.”Pilkington noted that Kischermann’s experience is a reminder that state residents who have questions about registering their guns ought to go through an FFL instead of the California Department of Justice website.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

As a result, Congress has done very little.”He went on to intimate that Republicans have refused to “prevent the abuse of power, and preserve the rule of law.”He said, “And so this fall, I’m going to support Democrats in their efforts to win control of the House.”Bloomberg did have praise for two Republicans–Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whom he referred to as his “friend,” and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), whom he praised for breaking with the NRA and supporting post-Sandy Hook gun controls, which would not have prevented the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

43,"CNN described Feinstein’s gun control as an attempt “to bar all gun sales to those individuals on the terror watch list.” They noted that she first pushed the controls after the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack, then revived the push following the shooting at Orlando Pulse. They did not mention the fact that Feinstein’s controls, even if they had been law, would not have prevented San Bernardino or the Orlando Pulse attack from happening, because none of the attackers were on a terror watch list.Yet Tester voted for Feinstein’s gun control.Beyond the obvious fact that the gun control would not have worked, because the attackers were not on a watch list, there is the greater concern that Feinstein’s controls would run roughshod over American’s due process rights. Consider two points: 1. Barring suspects from buying guns is the equivalent to presuming guilt before innocence and not the other way around. 2. Making matters worse, the terror watch list, and related no-fly list, is so unreliable–frequently misidentifying suspects–that individuals who were never suspects to begin with could be denied the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights for self-defense.But Feinstein supported it, along with gun control Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT), Harry Reid (D-NV), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Montana’s Jon Tester.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

44,"“There is a certain sacredness to Holocaust remembrance because, not only was it the largest genocide in the history of the world — six million Jews murdered, the Roma, the gypsies nearly exterminated — but it was unique in the annals of human crime in that it was an entire state apparatus conquering nearly all of Europe and leveraging all state resources to put Jews in boxcars and bring them to crematoria where Zyklon-B gas filled their lungs and murdered them,” Boteach explained.LISTEN: “The world has respected the fact that ‘Never Again’ resonates with Holocaust imagery specifically. It’s not as if we Jews have copyrighted the term, and it’s not as if we have a trademark. But there’s a certain sacredness, and no one has appropriated that term understanding that there’s never been a crime like this,” he said.“The problem with using it for anything else, and the reason why it’s inappropriate, is that it diminishes the uniqueness of that crime. It makes it sound like there are many crimes that are similar, and there is nothing like it. It doesn’t mean that other things aren’t horrible, and what happened in Parkland is absolutely horrible. It just means that there’s no comparison. The comparison should not be made. That’s what makes the use of the term inappropriate,” he said.Marlow recalled some use of terms like “never again” and “never forget” after the 9/11 terrorist attack and lamented the sad truth that many people do seem to have forgotten or failed to teach their children what happened on that day.“One of the parallels between — again, you can’t draw full a full comparison, but there are certain parallels between 9/11 and the Holocaust,” Boteach reflected. He said one of those parallels was the people who jumped to their deaths from the stricken World Trade Center.“The worst imagery of 9/11 were these people who chose to fling themselves from 105 stories rather than be consume by jet-fuel-fired heat,” he said. “In the Warsaw ghetto, Major General Jurgen Stroop, the SS commander who was executed after the war for war crimes, he called them ‘parachutists.’ He decided to burn the ghetto down, and he had them jump.”“I’m a values-based person,” Boteach said. “Looking at the gun debate from a values perspective, one of the reasons that the Warsaw uprising could not succeed even more, and they kept the Germans at bay for three weeks, is that they didn’t have enough arms. They were reliant on the Polish home army to get whatever arms they could get. They had small-caliber pistols, barely any bullets, every bullet counted, and they had Molotov cocktails. Had they had arms, they probably could have launched a much more successful revolt.”“Now, I’m not looking at the issue in American terms, where no one wants to see mass shootings,” he added. “I understand how people feel that this is what it’s leading to with the availability of guns. Having said that, I’m looking specifically at the use of ‘Never Again’ to promote gun control. The problem with that is that the Jews were kind of not allowed to have arms. They were stripped of arms and therefore could not fight back.” “The history of the uprising is how hard they were trying to get armed, to get any kind of arms by which to fight back. When people say, ‘Why wasn’t there more resistance?’ that was one of the issues. They were reliant on partisan groups to get arms from, and they had to develop these homemade things like Molotov cocktails,” he said.“Again, without wading even into the debate, he’s not even making his point,” Boteach said of Hogg’s book title. “It kind of makes the opposite point.”“I’m a rabbi, so I look at this through a very compassionate lens. He suffered trauma that we can barely comprehend. He lost his friends. So I’m not going to judge him harshly,” he said, advising Hogg and others who consider appropriating Holocaust themes to think carefully before using “imagery which is very sacred to a large number of people.”“There is a sacredness to ‘Never Again.’ It should not be misused. I would tell him gently and respectfully that it should not be misused and that the Holocaust was a unique crime in the annals of civilization,” he said.“It’s important for the sake of humanity, not just for the Jewish community, that its memory not be diluted because genocide is ever-present. We see the use of poison gas in Syria today. It’s only specifically by understanding the gravity and magnitude of the Holocaust that we ensure that we fight genocide so that it doesn’t continue,” Boteach said.Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.",0
45,"The Daily Mail reports that French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian responded by expressing “firm disapproval” of Trump’s suggestion that allowing people to be armed for self-defense would have made them safer.The Los Angeles Times reported that Trump referenced the attack as proof that gun control does not control bad people. He said, “Paris, France, has the toughest gun laws in the world. Nobody has guns in Paris.” He talked of how the gun-free status of patrons allowed the attackers to methodically kill at will. He said, “They took their time and gunned them down one by one.”Trump observed, “But if one employee, or just one patron had a gun, or if one person in this room had been there with a gun, the terrorists would have fled or been shot.”Despite the 130 killed in Paris that night, Le Drian said they will not “reconsider France’s choice on this issue.” He added, “‘Free circulation of weapons in society does not constitute a rampart against terrorist attacks, to the contrary, it can facilitate this type of attack.” In saying this, Le Drian ignored the fact that the attack occurred despite France’s strict gun controls.Trump’s observation is simply that the attack was made worse because the victims were rendered defenseless by the myriad gun laws in France.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

46,"After listening to Sen Chris Murphy (D-CT), Trump looked at toward the end of the table and asked Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) to detail their gun control bill.The Manchin/Toomey gun control bill is the same universal background check legislation supported by Barack Obama in the wake of the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. It the very bill that was defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate on April 17, 2013.Toomey described it for Trump, saying the bill “strengthens the reporting of information into the background check system” and “requires background checks on all commercial sales.” This is code-talk for requiring background checks on private gun sales, which Toomey described as sales at gun shows and online (even though online sales already require a background check).Manchin then spoke and suggested that West Virginians will support the Manchin/Toomey gun control bill if Trump will support it. He did not mention that the Manchin/Toomey bill would not have prevented the Florida attack — just as it would not have prevented the Sandy Hook attack that spawned it.Trump spoke of the using the Manchin/Toomey bill “as a base” to which other gun bills can be added, and then continued taking comments from various senators and representatives in attendance.When it was Rep. Scalise’s time to speak, he highlighted the crime-fighting value of concealed carriers and the need to pass national reciprocity legislation. National reciprocity was introduced in the House on January 3, 2017, and passed in the House on December 6, 2017. It was introduced in the Senate on March 1, 2017, and it has yet to come up for a vote nor has Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a word in support of it.Trump shut down Scalise’s reciprocity push, suggesting the gun control package being pieced together would never pass if national reciprocity were added to it.Trump looked at Scalise and said, “You know I’m your biggest fan in the whole world.

47,"CNN quoted Trump saying, “Half of you are so afraid of the NRA. And you know what? There’s nothing to be afraid of.”A senior administration official confirmed that the big sticking point between Trump and the NRA is Trump’s plan to raise the minimum age for rifle purchases from 18-years old 21-years old. But the White House did caveat that intention by suggesting the increased age may only be on “certain firearms.”Either way, the NRA opposes it, and NRA leadership made this clear during meetings with Trump over the weekend.But Trump remains determined. In addition to raising the minimum age for long gun purchases Trump is also rallying behind new gun laws for our background check system. These new laws were put forth by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and John Cornyn (R-TX), in legislation called “Fix NICS.” The legislation was introduced after the Air Force failed to report the Texas church shooter’s criminal conviction to the background check system, thus allowing him to legally acquire a gun.Ironically, while Trump’s support Cornyn’s action on background checks, Cornyn is not excited about Trump’s effort to raise the minimum age for long gun purchases. Cornyn doubts whether raising the minimum age for long gun purchases would save lives.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

51,"The state-level slide toward gun control began in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed a $400 million gun control bill into law. Breitbart News reported that the gun controls included firearm confiscation orders, waiting period for long gun purchases, and an increase in minimum purchase age from 18 to 21.The Los Angeles Times reported that the measure Rick Scott signed also banned bump stocks, which were not even used in the Parkland school shooting.On April 12, 2018, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) signed a massive body of gun controls into law. Those controls included a ban on private gun sales and bump stocks, although neither private gun sales nor bump stocks were contributors to the Parkland attack.Phil Scott’s gun controls also bar law-abiding citizens from owning “high capacity” magazines.Ironically, Phil Scott was able to win the gubernatorial race by proclaiming he saw no need for more gun control in the state of Vermont. On June 22, 2016, he told Vermont Public Radio, “I don’t believe that we need more gun restrictions in Vermont at this time. I think we should enforce the ones we have. I think we should focus more on safety and gun education, but also addressing the violence problem that is systemic across the country – and I don’t have the answers for that, but that’s what’s driving this frustration, this outrage.”On April 24, 2018, Huffington Post reported that Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed a bill which bans bump stocks and implements a law to allow police to confiscate firearms. The firearm confiscation law is described as a “red flag” law.On May 14, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) proposed confiscation laws for his state, as well as a tripling of the 24-hour waiting period on gun purchases. Rauner wants law-abiding citizens to wait 72 hours before being allowed to pick up their guns at the store and take them home.Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) had the opportunity to roll back gun controls and regulations via permitless carry legislation that reached her desk last week. Instead she vetoed the measure, thereby preserving the requirement that law-abiding citizens obtain permission from their state government before being allowed to exercise rights that “shall not be infringed.”NRA-ILA executive director Chris Cox responded to Fallin’s veto by saying, “Gov.

52,"Democrats are predominantly driving the legislative bump stocks ban while the NRA is asking the ATF to issue more regulations on bump stock accessories. The key to understanding these approaches is to understand that either avenue — legislative or regulative — represents gun control.The Democrats’ bump stock ban comes from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who, on October 8, told Face the Nation that no law would have stopped the Vegas attacker. She followed that admission by saying, “we need a law” banning bump stocks. She said ATF regulation would not be sufficient; a law is necessary.On the other hand, the NRA is asking Congress to stand down and let the ATF handle bump stocks by deciding whether they should be labeled Class III devices. Such a label would place them under the auspices of the National Firearms Act (1934) and make acquisition of the devices similar to the process law-abiding Americans have to endure for a short-barreled rifle or machine gun.An immediate problem with looking to the ATF is that the agency approved bump stocks for sale as accessories in 2010. The ATF found that the bump stocks did not convert a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic weapon. Rather, they were an accessory that let gun owners mimic automatic fire in short bursts. If the ATF reverses this ruling and equates a stock accessory with a conversion device, then the floodgates are wide open for the ATF to re-evaluate and regulate other similar accessories.In other words, the ATF route is a slope that is as slippery as the Democrats’ legislative push. Both avenues — legislative and regulative — mean more gun control.What makes the NRA’s ATF appeal even more perilous is that it provides cover for establishment Republicans who are trying to play both sides of the fence on gun control. They do not want to come out in support of legislative gun control, but they express openness to regulatory gun control via the ATF. In any other instance, they would be too afraid of the political fall-out to support the regulatory gun control push, but now that the NRA has taken it, establishment Republicans believe it is a safe step for them to support it too.For example, on October 6, a total of nine GOP Senators sent a letter requesting the ATF re-evaluate bump stock accessories. Frank Thorp tweeted a copy of the letter, which was signed by Sens. Dean Heller (R-NV), John Cornyn (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), James Inhofe (R-OK), Johnny Isakson (R-GA ), James Lankford (R-OH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tim Scott (R-SC), and John Thune (R-SD):9 GOP Senators send letter to the ATF asking them to re-review the legality of bump stocks: pic.twitter.com/hmNqoj9kYB— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 6, 2017Whether gun control succeeds legislatively or through regulation we get the same outcome — more gun control. That is because the Democrats’ bill already goes beyond bump stocks and — as stated above — a regulatory ruling against bump stocks will open the door to similar rulings on similar firearm accessories.The best course of action at this point in time is to stand and fight. Every gun owner and freedom-loving American should call his Representative and Senators and let them know gun control by any other name is still gun control. Say no to legislative gun control. Say no to regulatory gun control.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

53,"The letter says:The Republican leadership in Congress continues to sit on their hands as gun violence becomes America’s new normal,” and asks Obama to simply go away the people’s elected leadership and institute gun control unilaterally…Since Congress won’t step up, the President should. Through executive action he can help keep guns from criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. Something needs to be done and since Republicans in Congress can’t even bring themselves to hold a vote, this is the best option to make our country safer and save livesThe House Democrats’ push for executive action came on the same day that 24 Senate Democrats urged Obama to go around Congress and implement more gun control via executive action. The Senate action, which was headed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT), followed on the heels of Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-VA) calls for action following the August 26 on-air attack against a Virginia reporter and her cameraman.The August attack by gunman Vester Flanagan and the October 1 attack by a gunman at Umpqua Community College (UCC) both resulted in calls for executive action to expand background checks. However, such calls miss the larger fact that expanding background checks would not have stopped either attack, as Flanagan and the UCC gunman both passed background checks to acquire their firearms. The same is true of the July 23 attack at the Lafayette movie theater, the July 16 attack at Chattanooga military offices, and the June 17 attack at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The alleged gunmen in all of these instances passed background checks to acquire their firearms.So basically, we have 114 House Democrats and 24 Senate Democrats pushing gun control for gun control’s sake.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

54,"A host of National Public Radio’s Morning Edition asked Cameron Kasky, 17, about young people who disagree with him about guns.“I’ve read some really interesting op-eds by students about your age who say, you know, ‘I’m growing up in rural America. Guns are part of my family’s culture. I like target shooting. I don’t think guns are a bad thing,’” Noel King noted.“What do you say to a 17-year-old who fundamentally disagrees with you about some of this stuff?” King asked.“Well, I say we’re marching to protect you from other people like you who have guns,” Kasky said. “And I say that target shooting, while it is a sport, we’ve become the targets.”“We’re the targets now,” Kasky said. “We are running away from people like you.”The interview gave Kasky the opportunity to assert that the march, which is expected to draw as many as 500,000 to the nation’s capital and hundreds of other cities around the country and even some abroad, was still controlled by the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.But when asked about the protest’s left-wing supporters, Kasky admitted that adults helped pull off the D.C. event, which requires a federal permit, massive logistical support, and lots of money, including millions in insurance costs.King: You are working with progressive groups, though – right? – like Indivisible, which is a movement to resist the Trump agenda. You have dipped a toe into politics here.Kasky then said race is an issue in school shootings.Kasky: You know, our story was told because we are an affluent white community. And we have to shine the spotlight that was given on us on everybody in the world who has to deal with this on a daily basis. So people like Indivisible, who represent students who are in lower-income communities and don’t get to speak out the way we do because people don’t listen, we have to connect with these students.“So the leadership of this movement still is teenagers?” King asked.“Yes,” Kasky claimed. “And while we have people who help us, while we have people who can help us book hotels and get city permits, those aren’t the people controlling our message. Those aren’t the people writing our words. The only reason this has worked and the only reason this will continue to work is because we don’t let ourselves get bastardized by others.”In fact, a wide coalition of left-wing groups have been involved in organizing, promoting, and funding the march, including the anti-gun group Giffords, Move On, and Women’s March LA.",0

The student, a 14-year-old who lost his sister in the Parkland school shooting, voiced concern that requiring clear backpacks would violate students’ privacy.Kashuv responded by tweeting, “Instead, let’s violate Constitution?” which appears to be a reference to the gun control measures being pushed instead.Kasky responded by tweeting that he will no longer take part in the debate:Kyle, I’ve enjoyed my discussion about gun laws with you so far, but after seeing this, I think I’m out.

Moreover, while there have been no further school shootings involving handguns since the near-total handgun ban, Countryside Alliance research indicates that general handgun crime spiked by 40 per cent in the two years following its introduction.This process appears to have accelerated in recent years, with gun crime for all types of firearms in London increasing by 42 per cent between 2016 and 2017.Law-abiding citizens may not carry firearms, pepper spray, or articles of any kind for self-defence anywhere in the United Kingdom except Northern Ireland — where serving and former members of the police and Armed Forces may apply for a personal protection weapon — and self-defence is not considered a valid reason for keeping a firearm at home.This contrasts sharply with the United States, where law-abiding citizens, as well as criminals, may carry guns, with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research indicating that millions of crimes are thwarted by defensive gun uses every year.",0

64,"Except for remaining in-state inventories, these so-called “high capacity” magazines, will no longer be available to Vermonters, effective immediately.  Ordinary Vermonters will no longer be able to import these magazines from neighboring New Hampshire, where such magazines are perfectly legal.  How Vermont will enforce this law to prevent a homicidal madman from bringing thirty round magazines into Vermont to do his worst, is not even questioned, but that is exactly who this feel-good law is supposed to deter.  Like most gun-control laws, this law will only affect the law-abiding.  Still, the politicians will pat themselves on their backs and imagine they “did something”.And they have done something. They’ve limited the rights of Vermonters and they’ve endangered the innocent and the law-abiding.  All to no effect.  This, of course, is what is called in psychology; “magical thinking.”  Violent criminals and homicidal lunatics will still be out there, waiting to prey on the innocent — undeterred by this unenforceable law.  After all, the Parkland school massacre was committed with ten round magazines.Thanks to Governor Scott, Vermonters will now be denied the same tools that police and government officials see as ordinary and necessary to protect themselves. It is standard issue gear for American police to carry AR-15s along with multiple 30-round magazines in their cruisers.  These 30 round magazines that Vermont has now banned, are the same standard magazines that are issued to both police and various federal government agencies.  Since we, the citizens, are usually the first people to encounter a criminal predator (before the police are ever called), don’t ordinary individuals need as much firepower as the police?  Isn’t your life worth as much protection?  Remember, we will likely encounter the criminal first, contact the police, and then the police will eventually show up.  Sometimes to do nothing more than to draw a chalk outline around an unfortunate victim. The reality is that Vermont has decided that the police get the benefit of being protected by high-capacity magazines while ordinary Vermonters, including family members of the police, are denied the right and ability to protect themselves from the same criminal predators walking the same streets that the police patrol.  Do ordinary Vermonters face different criminal predators than the police? Will Governor Scott and the legislature promise Vermonters kinder and gentler criminals and madmen to go with their reduced capacity magazine law?Although there is an exception in the law that grandfathers in existing magazines, the reality is that the Governor and the Vermont legislature have decided that only the police should be allowed the benefit of having ‘high-capacity’ magazines to protect themselves.  The peasants, the people foolish enough to have believed Phil Scott’s campaign promises, not so much.Vermont, which has never even required a permit for concealed carry, has now decided to follow Governor Cuomo of New York and climb onto the slippery slope of gun control with magazine limits. This, despite the fact that for years, Vermont has consistently been ranked near the bottom of states for gun homicides, with virtually no state gun control laws at all.  Yes, you read that correctly.What lessons can we draw from the tragedies of Parkland, the Pulse nightclub, the Nice truck attack and the Bataclan Concert Hall attack in Paris?  The police will not always be there to protect you. They may arrest the criminals after the crime, but they cannot always be there to prevent it.Never forget: You are your own first responder. Mostly, the police function merely as your backup. Maybe they’re minutes away, or maybe they’re hours away, like at the Pulse nightclub.  You can’t know.   Ask the relatives of the people who bled out at the Pulse nightclub while SWAT waited outside for three hours and then afterward was awarded medals for heroism.The violent thugs against whom the police arm themselves rarely prey on well-armed police. This is why most mass shootings occur in “gun-free” zones.One would be hard-pressed to find anyone who has ever been in a shootout saying they wished they had brought less ammunition. Criminal activity is often a group activity.  There are partners in crime, accomplices, aiders and abettors, and terrorist cells.  Columbine had two shooters. San Bernardino had two shooters.   September 11?  19 attackers.  And the list goes on.Police carry extra loaded magazines on their duty belt for a reason. They lug around the additional weight because their lives depend on it.  You need a standard 30 round magazine for your rifle for the same reason your pistol needs a standard 15, or 17 round magazine. More ammunition is always better. Once you’re out of ammo, you’re out of the fight.Anyone who insists that magazine capacity limits will deter a madman bent on committing mass murder is naïve, ignorant or else has an entirely different agenda.  The perpetrator in the Virginia Tech shooting used two semi-automatic pistols in his attacks – a .22 caliber and a 9mm. He also had as many as 19 magazines holding 10-15 rounds each.  The perpetrator in the Parkland shooting used only 10-round magazines in his rifle.  Proposals to limit magazine size to 10 rounds would have had likely had no impact at all on the lethality of these attacks.  Nor will they deter a determined killer like the perpetrator in Nice, France, who drove a 19-ton “assault” truck into a crowd killing 85 and injuring 400 innocents.Finally, it’s interesting to see how these same magazines and the weapons they’re designed for, are described by our betters in Washington.  When the United States Department of Homeland Security buys rifles, ‘assault weapons’ magically morph into ‘personal defense weapons’, even though they add full-auto capability.  And if that isn’t magical enough for you, the dreaded ‘high capacity magazine’ of gun controller’s nightmares, now becomes the “standard” 20 and 30 round M16 magazine and Magpul 30 round PMAG.’  No mention of ‘ten round magazines’ or ‘high capacity magazines’ here at all.  Sorry, DHS and ICE just aren’t interested. Why is that?   Just the “standard” magazines for them, please, Homeland Security must be defending a different homeland than the one Vermonters live in.The calculus of human nature applies to limiting magazine capacity.  If 30-round magazines are outlawed, only outlaws (and the government) will have 30-round magazines. Gun control measures restricting magazine size serve only to advantage criminals and put the law-abiding into greater jeopardy.If Vermont and other state governments wish to deny Americans the right to own and use the formerly ‘standard’, but now ‘high-capacity’ magazines, then perhaps Vermont law enforcement including Governor Scott’s security detail, will lead the way and switch to ten round magazines.Just to set the example for the rest of us.Mark W.

66,"Fallon also highlighted Clinton’s support of universal background checks–which have already failed in California, Colorado, Washington state, and Paris–and her support for a scenario wherein victims of crime would be able to sue gun manufacturers.In the email, dated October 4, 2015, Fallon mentions that Today had made clear they were going to ask Clinton about guns. At that time she was still locked in a tougher stance than expected primary opponent Bernie Sanders. Fallon wrote:Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability.Breitbart News has previously reported that Clinton pledged gun control by executive order. She began pushing executive gun control right after the shooting in the Umpqua Community College gun free zone. That incident occurred on October 1, 2015, three days before Fallon’s email that Clinton “would support…closing the gun show loophole by executive order.” This is in line with a Washington Post report that Clinton wants to use executive orders “to go further than Obama” went  on gun control.It is interesting to note that the Umpqua Community College gunman passed a background check for his weapons, so Clinton’s “universal background checks” would have done nothing to stop the attack. Moreover, he did not acquire them at a private sale at a gun show, so any successful executive action against gun shows would have been powerless to stop the attack as well.Her plan to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims will not reduce crime either, but it will bankrupt–and eventually end–gun manufacturing in the United States. Senator Bernie Sanders warned of this during the March 6, 2016, Democrat debate, when he said, “If [gun makers] are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you’re really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don’t agree with that.”AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

67,"Think about it — celebrities went gun control crazy following the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack. Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Melissa McCarthy, Adam Scott, Laura Dern, and others even took part in a Everytown for Gun Safety PSA, in which they urged opposition to proposed concealed carry laws as a result of the attack.And celebrities called for more gun control within hours of the November 5, 2017, Texas church attack. Such celebrities included Sarah Silverman, Stephen King, Josh Gad, Chelsea Handler, Joy Reid, Adam McKay, among others.Following the February 14, 2018, Parkland school attack, celebrities came out in droves for gun control and they brought their friends. They expressed their solidarity with student gun control advocates, praised the idea of a national march for gun control, and George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Jeffrey Katzenberg pledged $500,000 each to help fund the march.Yet, after the YouTube HQ shooting what did we hear? … Crickets.Sure, actor Michael Ian Black blamed the NRA and called for more gun control before the facts of the shooting were known. Actress Alyssa Milano appeared to blamed the NRA as well. But these two proved to be outliers. The usual Hollywood suspects remained eerily quiet and a few, like Judd Apatow, just retweeted the crazy gun control comments Michael Ian Black was churning out.Why the silence? After all, three innocents were shot with a firearm in an attack that seized the nation’s attention.The answer is found by understanding the common denominators in stories onto which leftist celebrities usually seize.For example, Las Vegas, the Texas church, and Parkland all feature white male gunmen. This fits well into the left’s lexicon and furthers their opportunity for discussing certain other political categories — like racism, white privilege, etc.Also note that an AR-15 was used in Vegas, Texas, and Parkland. This, too, is a convenient fit into their “assault weapons” or “assault rifle” phraseology, and it furthers the left’s opportunity to claim that AR-15s have become the “weapon of choice” for mass shooters.Then came April 3, and news began pouring in about an active shooter at YouTube HQ. A collective gasp filled rooms where celebrities sat and talked, as they waited to see if this would be the attack that finally put their gun control push over the top. But as they waited, the news faltered. The shooter was a female. Moreover, she was Iranian. And she used a handgun instead of an “assault weapon.”It was learned that the YouTube HQ shooter had passed a background check for her handgun and had registered it with the state, per California law. Additionally, Breitbart News reported that California already has every law that has been proposed as a solution to the Parkland attack — including gun confiscation orders — but none of these laws stopped the YouTube HQ shooting.So celebrities moved on, choosing silence over the option of drawing attention to a shooting that highlights the impotence of every gun control law they support, demonstrates the weakness of the claim that AR-15s are the “weapon of choice,” and deviates from their preferred category of “white male shooter.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

69,"As a result, Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) is pressing for more gun control.According to WJZ, murders occur so frequently in Baltimore that the number of murders in the city is higher than the number in Philadelphia, even though Philadelphia “has two and a half times the population.” Moreover, Baltimore sees more murders than New York City, although NYC “is almost 14 times larger.”But the real giveaway on the level of violence in Baltimore is the report that the city’s murder rate “more than doubles Chicago’s.”On March 27, 2017, Breitbart News reported that the criminal use of “high capacity” magazines in Baltimore had risen since a ban on the devices was put in place. Maryland banned the sale and manufacture of such magazines in 2013, yet the Trace—a gun control journalism outlet—shows that the criminal use of such magazines jumped in 2013 and continued to climb in 2014, 2015, and 2016.The Trace quotes Baltimore Police spokesman T.J. Smith, who said, “We’re dealing with absolute criminals who want as much weaponry as possible when they’re going after their targets. They’re not carrying .22s. They’re carrying the big guns that have these high capacities.”Rather than see this crime and murder wave as the fulfillment of countless warnings that a ban on “high capacity” magazines would mean only criminals have “high capacity” magazines, the leadership is Baltimore is seeking ways to put even more gun control in place. Of course, any new gun laws—including any new bans—will mean more types of firearms and accessories will only be in the hands of criminals, thereby giving criminals an even greater advantage.For example, an “assault weapons” ban was enacted simultaneously with the “high capacity” magazine ban. That ban immediately guaranteed that criminals with “assault weapons” would possess a firepower advantage over law-abiding citizens. Likewise, requirements that law-abiding citizens submit fingerprints to the Maryland State Police when buying a handgun was also enacted with the “high capacity” magazine and “assault weapons” bans.Does anyone really believe the individuals who are killing one another in Baltimore are submitting fingerprints before pulling the trigger?AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

70,"In remarks to NBC News on Thursday, Bill Murray wrote:You’ve got to surround a deeply political issue like gun control or a war, to come at it from every single direction. You can’t just focus on one thing, or aim for just the one goal.Ending the Vietnam war was not a simple thing, either: You had to make sure that all our people were safe; we had to make sure that they were as safe as you could be. And, you might remember, people thought it was going to be the end of the world if we lost Vietnam. But that war had to stop.And now, well, Vietnam is one of the most wonderful places to go in the world. People love going there; they love the people. And we all survived: they survived, we survived. People will survive. If you can just stop shooting at them, they really do pretty well.Vietnam did not become a land of sweetness and light because crusading hippies convinced America to end the war. Instead, America’s departure unleashed one of the most horrifying tides of murderous cruelty ever witnessed by the human race.Bill Murray is not an oblivious twentysomething whose left-wing teachers just kind of forgot to mention the killing fields of Cambodia when they taught him about the Seventies, so he should not need anyone to remind him of what actually happened, but here goes.South Vietnam was swiftly overrun by the savage North Vietnamese after the American withdrawal in 1975. The good guys with guns left, so the bad guys with guns rolled in and started murdering people on an industrial scale.Pound for pound, Vietnamese Communism was one of the most bloodthirsty ideologies the world has ever known. They managed to kill ten percent of the national population by the time they were done with their wars and purges. The carnage was staggering. Up to 2.5 million South Vietnamese were marched off to “re-education camps,” where at least 165,000 of them died of starvation, disease, exhaustion from hard labor, summary execution, and exploding land mines.Another million South Vietnamese were thrown out of their homes to make way for the conquering Communists and forcibly relocated to areas so uninhabitable that a journalist described them as “a prefabricated hell and a place one comes to only if the alternative to it would be death.” Up to 155,000 of them died out there.Another two million gun-free Vietnamese decided to avoid the prefabricated hell their heavily armed conquerors planned for them, so they threw themselves and their families into just about anything that could float and set sail for Europe, America, and Australia. They were at sea for six months in some cases, facing everything from pirates and storms to malnutrition and disease.Of the two million Vietnamese Boat People who fled the Communist horror, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 died at sea or in refugee camps.The Vietnamese Communists had a lively spinoff franchise in Cambodia known as the Khmer Rouge, managed by a fellow called Pol Pot, a Hall of Fame monster in the annals of genocide. Two years after America pulled out of Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge overthrew the U.S.-backed government of Cambodia.A few days later, the gun-toting Communists marched the politically undesirable members of their gun-free captive populace into concentration camps even more brutal than those of Vietnam, or simply murdered them on the spot and shoveled them into mass graves.There are individual fields in Cambodia where over 10,000 people were murdered. There is a concentration camp that took in 14,000 inmates, but only seven of them survived. The overall death toll from the four-year Cambodian genocide has been estimated at 2 million against a total national population of just 7 million.Here is a little irony for Bill Murray to savor: the Khmer Rouge leaders were highly educated student activists who were absolutely convinced they knew what was best for society. They were positively brimming with youthful idealism! They told their critics: “To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss.”So no, Mr. Murray, we didn’t all survive America’s withdrawal from Vietnam. Peace and love did not blossom across the region as a result. And while Vietnam is doubtless much improved today over the first decades after the Vietnam War, and is becoming a significant U.S. strategic ally against China’s regional ambitions, it remains a Communist tyranny with precious little political freedom or respect for basic human rights.Freedom of speech, opinion, assembly, and religion are highly restricted in modern Vietnam. Dissidents are harassed by the police, detained, and assaulted. “Elections” are even more of a joke than the one Russia just held. Human-rights activists are detained to keep them from meeting with foreign leaders. Surveillance is pervasive. Members of disfavored religious groups have been forced to renounce their faith in public. Legal processes are dubious at best. Modest improvements are noted from time to time, but Vietnam has a long way to go before it fits any rational definition of a liberal democracy.One of the biggest complaints lodged by Vietnamese human rights activists is that people like Bill Murray keep pretending the place is a reformist paradise where the commie stuff happened a million years ago. U.S. administrations under both Republican and Democratic presidents have muted their criticism of the appalling police state in Hanoi as they seek improved diplomatic and economic ties. Activists have expressed disappointment in the apathetic response from the United Nations as well.“The thing that’s so powerful about students is that, when you haven’t had your idealism broken yet, you’re able to speak from a place that has no confusion, where there is a clear set of values,” Bill Murray said on Thursday.The thing that is so dangerous about the Left’s cynical manipulation of youthful idealism is that complex truth is replaced with simplistic fairy tales, symbolic gestures, and emotional appeals. If your “clear set of values” is based on deceptively edited history, then it is time to get a new set of values.Bill Murray could start by apologizing to all the families he wronged by airbrushing the horrors perpetrated against them, brushing up on the real history of Vietnam from 1975 to today, and understanding how that history makes the exact opposite point about gun control than the one he intended.",0
71,"On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher and rapper and activist Michael Render, aka Killer Mike, discussed gun control. They argued that there is a racial component to gun control, questioned whether banning assault weapons is particularly important, and discussed the consistency of people on the left arguing for more gun control while believing President Trump is a tyrant.Maher brought up gun control and said that because there weren’t any mass shootings this week, it’s now okay to talk about the issue. He quickly turned to the controversy over Render’s appearance on NRATV. Maher stated that liberals should respect diversity of opinion before saying, “I think liberals are going to have to come to terms with the fact that there’s a racial component to this debate.”Render agreed. He cited a Washington Post article about the racial history of gun control laws and how they have been used to control people of color. After recapping the article, he added, “So pretty much, if I’m a white man in America, you’re telling me that by owning a gun, I am a part of law enforcement. What does that — what happens because of that? You kill black children because their music is loud. What happens when you’re that emboldened? You track a black boy behind a building, you engage him in a fight, you begin to lose, you murder him, and then you are let off the hook because of stand your ground.”He then contrasted this with the case of Siwatu-Salama Ra.Render further stated that African-Americans should “stop and have a conversation with your allies and say this, these laws are going to affect us worst and they’re going to affect us first. If you put more police in school, you’re going to see more African-American children engaged by police in a violent manner, the same way the little girl was slammed out of0 her desk, the same way the little girl was slammed at a pool party. And I’m simply saying to our allies, wait and let’s talk about it. Because laws that are introduced are going affect my community worst and first.”Maher then said, “It’s a matter of self-reliance. Police don’t always show up in the poorer neighborhoods.”Render agreed, stating, “They’re not going to show up in poorer neighborhoods. They’re not going to show up in rural neighborhoods. Because we underfund our police forces. They lack the training they properly need, and we don’t have the type of officers we need in the community.”Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich agreed with Render on the issue of unequal application of the law, but argued that an assault weapons ban and universal background checks are “critical.”Maher and Render then questioned whether banning assault weapons is “critical.” Maher said that while he doesn’t like guns, he owns one because the police might not get there on time. He then said that while banning assault weapons is a good applause line, he isn’t sure that’s the big issue, given the number of deaths caused by rifles.Render then said, “You’re saying to a population of people, ‘This guy is a tyrant. You’re living under tyrannical times,’ and you’re comparing him to Adolf Hitler. When you do that to my community, I must take it seriously. I must take it seriously. Because not only am I seeing gun violence around crime and poverty in my community, I am seeing officers of the state murder my children, murder my women. So, when we start to say, ‘Tyranny could never happen.’ If you’re African-American, tyranny is happening now. Not happening — not potentially happening, we are being murdered at a higher rate and engaged by agents of the state. And when we say assault weapons, we ignore the fact that the Second Amendment says in case of tyranny. If a soldier or a cop can own a version of an AR-15, I am not comfortable in a country where I am being asked to de-arm and they are not.”Render further stated that there’s no such thing as an assault weapon.Reich pointed to the definition used in the Assault Weapons Ban Act and stated the law decreased mass shootings.Render countered by pointing to the disproportionate way laws end up enforced and talked about the 1994 Crime Bill. He added, “[T]o African-Americans, it is going to affect you first and worst if we simply jump on the bandwagon and say, ‘Pass all the laws –.'”Maher then stated, “If you really believe that Donald Trump is an authoritarian leader, capable of using force to suppress the opposition, I wonder if liberals are going to be rethinking their feelings about guns a little bit.”Reich responded by talking about Trump allies like Roger Stone discussing a civil war if Trump is impeached and argued that if people don’t stand up for the rule of law, there won’t be anything left. Maher agreed with this point.Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
72,"And they are doing all this to ban bump stocks, a product the ATF evaluated and approved in 2010.The ATF approved the stocks because they are accessories for semiautomatics rather than conversion devices that turn semiautomatics into fully automatic weapons. Curbelo’s bill gets around the ATF’s approval by explicitly banning certain accessories for AR-15s, even if those accessories “[do] not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun.”And like the Democrat bill–put forward by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)–Curbelo’s bill is already broader than bump stocks alone. In other words, it is a ban that will keep on giving for the Democrats and other gun control proponents.Here are the nine Republicans who are co-sponsoring Curbelo’s bill:The push to ban bump stocks is especially rich in light of the fact that using the devices probably made the Vegas attacker less effective than he would have been without them. After all, bump stocks are made for novelty rather than precision. For this reason, U.S. Army Sergeant First Class special forces soldier Tony Cowden suggests the Vegas attacker could have been deadlier if he had shot slower with a rifle not outfitted with a bump stock:Bump stocks may have made Paddock less deadly https://t.co/90ddK51Y8w pic.twitter.com/eC42rf8k11— Justin Miller (@justinjm1) October 4, 2017Moreover, the effect one achieves with a bump stock can be achieved with an index finger and a belt-loop; no bump stock device needed. So what will Republican gun controllers do if they ban bump stocks and realize that people are still having fun with their rifles via blue jean belt loops? Will they ban belt loops?In summary–Bump stocks are accessories, not conversion kits. They are novelties that reduce accuracy by producing a short, rapid-fire effect that can be achieved using nothing more than a finger and belt loop. For these reasons, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) stresses that bump stock gun control is part of a larger misdirection that creates a “slippery slope” Democrats can exploit for more gun control in the future. Yet Reps. Peter King, Leonard Lance, Patrick Meehan, Ed Royce, Chris Smith, Erik Paulsen, Ryan Costello, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Charlie Dent are rallying behind Curbelo’s gun control bill.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast. He is also the political analyst for Armed American Radio.

According to CIS, there are about 300 state and local governments “with laws, rules, or policies that impede federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.” CIS reports that since 2014 an estimated 10,000 criminal aliens who were released due to sanctuary city policies were arrested again on new criminal charges.

74,"In a blog post, Citi group announced:Under this new policy, we will require new retail sector clients or partners to adhere to these best practices: (1) they don’t sell firearms to someone who hasn’t passed a background check, (2) they restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21 years of age, and (3) they don’t sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. This policy will apply across the firm, including to small business, commercial and institutional clients, as well as credit card partners, whether co-brand or private label. It doesn’t impact the ability of consumers to use their Citi cards at merchants of their choice.Bans on bump stocks and high-capacity magazines have been a key demand of progressive gun control advocates. But whereas the usual method of activism has been to lobby representatives for change via the democratic process, Citi group is now imposing the change unilaterally — without asking their clients or customers.Citi promised to “respect the decision” of clients that chose not to follow their guidelines, and “work with them to transition their business away from Citi.”Since Donald Trump took office, corporations have been taking a growing role in public life, as progressive globalists try to use corporate power to advance their agenda. Leftist publications like the New York Times and Vox have gone so far to declare corporations the new “moral voice” of America — a stark contrast to the usual anti-capitalist attitudes of the left.But some companies are facing a backlash for their attempts to impose progressive values on their customers and clients.

Erin Scott/ZUMA WireFollowing the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month, all eyes are on the students who have garnered an unprecedented amount of national attention from their calls for gun control. In the couple of weeks since the shooting, the students have grilled politicians on live television, mocked conspiracy theorists on Twitter, and inspired hundreds of people across the country to demand action from their state legislators and from Washington.Three major national protests are already in the works and will take place over the next few months, adding to a regular stream of local activism. Here’s a look at what to expect:March 14: “Enough” national school walk outWith leadership from the Women’s March organizers, students and teachers across the country are planning “Enough“—a national school walkout scheduled for March 14.According to the event’s Facebook page, the walk out will begin at 10 a.m. in each time zone and last for 17 minutes, one minute for every victim who died in the Parkland shooting; 33,000 people have RSVP-ed on Facebook that they will attend. Dozens of schools are listed on the Enough homepage as participating.“We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns. Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that address the public health crisis of gun violence,” the organizers write on the march’s homepage. “We want Congress to pay attention and take note: many of us will vote this November and many others will join in 2020.”March 24: March For Our LivesTen days later, on March 24, the “March For Our Lives” will descend on Washington, D.C. The organizing for this rally began with survivors of the Parkland shooting but now involves students nationwide. Their goal is to demand that a “comprehensive and effective bill be immediately” introduced in Congress to address gun violence. “March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,” the organizers write on their website. “In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut short in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March For Our Lives believes the time is now.” This march gained additional notoriety last week when celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and George Clooney each promised to donate $500,000 to the march. According to the Washington Post, organizers expect nearly 500,000 attendees in Washington. There will also be dozens of sister marches across the country. April 20: National High School WalkoutOn the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, another national walk out will take place—this one organized by Lane Murdock, a 15 year-old high school student in Connecticut, to protest gun violence in schools and inaction by lawmakers.Murdock created a petition on Change.org to publicize the walk-out: “Public school shootings affect communities and especially teenagers,” she wrote. “On February, 14th a High School shooting in Parkland, Florida occurred, killing 17 people. Still, POTUS has not addressed any form of gun legislation. The majority of teenagers have no right to vote, leaving our voice unheard.” Around 200,000 people have signed the petition online, committing to walk out of their schools on April 20, and teachers across the country are planning to join. According to the Hartford Courant, students will also stand in silence for 17 minutes for each victim of the tragedy. Are there other protests being planned, perhaps in your local area?

1,"Oliver Contreras/SIPA USA via APPresident Trump is finally talking about gun control three days after a mass shooting that left 17 people dead and injured at least 14 others at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The president was silent about the issue in a speech at the White House on Thursday, where he offered condolences to the families of the students and teachers murdered and said he would meet with lawmakers and others to discuss school safety. He also visited victims and their families in Broward County on Friday. On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted:Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018In terms of partisan politics, tighter gun regulations have long been much more favored by Democrats than Republicans, but two gun control measures failed to pass in the Senate in 2013, when Democrats held the majority. Last year, Trump revoked an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase guns.In the wake of the mass shooting this week, outraged students in Florida and elsewhere have demanded that politicians take action on gun control.",1
2,"Jose Luis Magana/APOne month after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students from across the country walked out of class to protest Congress’ inaction on gun violence. And as they did, Congress responded—sort of. With teenagers demonstrating outside the Capitol, both the House and Senate on Wednesday made vague efforts to deal with school safety issues, holding votes and hearings that attempted to address the matter without actually tightening gun laws.Fix this before I text my mom from under a desk #NationalSchoolWalkout pic.twitter.com/bk820wL7Kt— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018In the House, members voted to pass the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that reauthorizes a 2001 Justice Department program designed to prevent school violence. It provides $50 million in federal funding to help schools train staff in identifying mental health issues and violent behavior; establish an anonymous reporting system; and pay for school security measures, such as metal detectors and locks. The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, includes no gun-related provisions. And while it received overwhelming bipartisan support―only 10 members opposed it―Democrats have sharply criticized GOP lawmakers for not doing more to curtail access to guns.The bill represents the first major vote on school safety since the February shooting in Parkland, but it was not originally a reaction to the massacre. A bipartisan group of lawmakers―including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), who represents Parkland―introduced the bill at the end of January, and it had received support from anti-school-violence groups at that time. Deutch told Politico that “it is in no way a response to Stoneman Douglas and does not address the gun violence epidemic in our country.” Following the shooting, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced companion legislation in the Senate, where it was met with similarly broad, bipartisan support.Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2018In the Senate, the Judiciary committee held a hearing Wednesday to investigate the failures of federal authorities to effectively respond to warning signs displayed by the Florida gunman. Senators took the opportunity to grill FBI Acting Deputy Director David Bowdich on the White House’s gun and school safety proposals and to ask about other potential reform measures. Bowdich―who’s held the job since the end of January, following the resignation of Andrew McCabe―seemed to leave at least some lawmakers unsatisfied.For example, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) brought up Trump’s proposal for arming teachers and pointed to research showing that harsh school discipline often disproportionately affects students of color. When Harris asked Bowdich if the White House plan would include implicit bias training designed to prevent teachers from shooting innocent students, Bowdich said, “I never really put the two together.”Officials from the Secret Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives received a similar reception from lawmakers when they failed to answer questions about the efficacy of student risk assessments and background checks for gun sales. And incredibly, none of the three executive branch representatives were familiar with the Dickey Amendment, federal legislation that prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding public health research into gun violence.Members of the Parkland community also weighed in at the hearing, including Stoneman Douglas teacher Katherine Posada and Ryan Petty, the father of a student killed in the shooting. Petty urged Congress to follow the example of lawmakers in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott (R) just signed a package of bipartisan gun restrictions over the objections of the National Rifle Association. The Florida legislation established a three-day waiting period for gun sales, raised the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21, and provided $400 million for mental health services and school safety resources, such as bulletproof glass and metal detectors. Petty said he hopes to spend Thursday meeting with Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss how the parties could find common ground on the issue.The march is on the way to the Capitol building #nationalschoolwalkout pic.twitter.com/KdeOuCnVcY— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018Despite the calls from students and activists across the country, no gun control measures have gained any traction in Congress in the month since the Parkland shooting—repeating a pattern that has persisted since the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. As that stalemate continues, Congress’ school safety conversations will proceed. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) says the House plans to hold its own oversight hearing on the FBI’s failures to investigate the Florida gunman prior to the shooting. And next week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is expected to appear before two House committees to discuss the White House’s plans to address gun violence.",1
3,"Royce Christensen, Las Vegas massacre survivor, attends his first gun safety rally.Mother Jones/Al Kamalizad“Damn!” says Royce Christensen, 22, beaming at his mother, Darla, as they troop through Saturday’s March for Our Lives demonstration in Salt Lake City, Utah. They make their way along the route from West High School to the steps of the state Capitol building, and the crowd chants, “Vote them out!” It’s a huge turnout. “And this is a red state!” Christensen exclaims.“Imagine what D.C. is like,” replies Darla.“Yeah,” Christensen nods. “D.C.”Royce wore a T-shirt to the march that identifies who he is: “Survivor,” it reads. “#VegasStrong.” Nearly six months ago, Royce and several members of his family were working as security guards at the Route 91 musical festival in Las Vegas when a barrage of bullets rained down in what would come to be known as the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Royce felt the bullets zipping overhead, kicking up shards of aluminum as they hit the stage. He saw people drop.And so on the cusp of the half-year anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre, we traveled with Christensen and his family as they drove north from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah, where they met up with Christensen’s fiancé to attend the March for Our Lives rally. It’s the first political rally that Christensen has ever marched in. On the drive up, he had said he wanted to “make something happen” after the Vegas shooting, and when he saw “the opportunity join something that seems to actually be gaining traction, that seems to be gripping onto the steps of the government for once,” he had to be part of it.He began the morning “ready for this,” but also nervous. He’d heard that there would be a counter-protest and that some of those demonstrators would be carrying weapons. He was also nervous that his ideas about gun control wouldn’t entirely align with those expressed at the rally. He’s had fun target shooting in the past. He doesn’t want the Second Amendment abolished. On the one hand, “Guns are awesome,” he says. On the other: “They need to be controlled.”Mother Jones first met Christensen two days after the Las Vegas massacre last October at a candlelit vigil, where he told the story of how he had tried to keep people calm and hidden as the gunfire blared on. When it was finally over, thousands of bullets and 10 long minutes later, he saw a truck, its bed filled with the wounded, speeding toward a hospital. The concert ground was “a maze of bodies.”“As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now.”Christensen wasn’t hit with a bullet during the Las Vegas massacre, but he’s been suffering ever since. He has a hard time sleeping, and when he does, his sleep is filled with nightmares. Tall buildings and balconies that someone could fire from make him nervous. When a car backfires or someone lights fireworks—not uncommon occurrences in Las Vegas, where he lives—he reacts, diving behind his bed or running through the house, switching off lights and pulling down blinds. He takes medicine for post-traumatic stress and sees a therapist at least once a week. Christensen has the rare gift of photographic memory, but nowadays, it feels like a curse. “As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now,” he says.At the rally, there’s a booming crowd of “people who care about what has happened,” he says. “I thought maybe 30, 50 people [would show up]. I think this is at least 400 people already. I did not think this many would show up at all.”He’s looked at the signs people carry and has listened to their goals for gun safety, and their fight for gun control doesn’t feel too extreme for him.”These people want common sense changes,” he says. “They don’t want to get rid of the Second Amendment.”If the counter-protestors are here with their guns, he doesn’t see them.As protesters chant, “Enough is enough!” and “Never Again!” he chants with them. When he meets other attendees, he introduces himself as a “proud survivor of the worst mass shooting in modern American history” and tells them that he’s marching with the hope that there will never be a new “worst mass shooting” again.Once the march reaches the Capitol building, Royce sits with his fiancé and his mother on the steps, facing a crowd that has grown to 8,000 people. While they listen to speeches from the student organizers, he and Darla lock eyes, and Darla weeps.After the last speech ends and the plaza clears, Christensen remains on the steps, awestruck. “I have not seen this kind of motivation before,” he says. “This is something new; I can feel it in the air.”Prior to the trip to Salt Lake City, Christensen sent a note to Mother Jones, full with anger, but also hope: “Pardon my French but when the worst shooting in United States history happened absolutely fucking nothing was done. When the church shooting that soon followed again absolutely nothing happened government-wise. Now after the Florida school shooting a large outcry is finally loud enough and has the staying power. I want to make sure that everyone remembers all the lives lost. I think this time these kids might change the world.”Now, after the rally, he’s even more hopeful and motivated. “This is change coming.”",1
4,"During a televised meeting with Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House, President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to broadly support a wide range of initiatives aimed at preventing future mass shootings. They ranged from endorsing stronger background checks to implementing “offensive” capabilities inside schools.One of the most striking moments came when it became increasingly clear that Trump was unfamiliar with the contents of the Manchin-Toomey bill, which famously failed to pass the Senate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. The 2013 legislation, which focused on expanding background checks and was strongly supported by then-President Barack Obama, marks the closest Congress has come in recent years to passing meaningful gun-control legislation. The speech Obama gave in response to the bill’s failure is regarded as his angriest public display. But on Wednesday, Trump appeared to blame his predecessor for the bill’s failure. It was just one of several times the president seemed to suggest that Obama didn’t push hard enough on gun control while in office. Trump also accused Toomey, who was in the room for Wednesday’s meeting, of being “afraid of the NRA” for not including language to raise the minimum age to purchase certain weapons.Sen. Pat Toomey tells President Trump that the Manchin-Toomey bill doesn’t deal with raising age limits from 18 to 21 to buy certain weapons.Trump: “You know why, because you are afraid of the NRA” https://t.co/vGNDzAlLt0— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 28, 2018At another point, Trump said he supported illegally seizing firearms from potential killers first, and then dealing with the due process. “I like taking the guns early,” he said in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s suggestion to do the exact opposite.WATCH: President Trump: ""I like taking the guns early … Take the guns first, go through due process second."" pic.twitter.com/aydEZdAGq0— NBC News (@NBCNews) February 28, 2018Trump later raised eyebrows when he suggested that a ban on assault weapons should also be included in the Manchin-Toomey bill. The surprising proposal was reminiscent of the January meeting at which lawmakers from both parties came together with the president to talk about immigration, and Trump agreed with Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s push for a clean bill on DACA. (Trump, of course, quickly backtracked, and later sought to kill a bipartisan bill many observers considered Congress’ best shot at a DACA resolution.)Nevertheless, Feinstein, who was sitting next to Trump at Wednesday’s meeting, looked quite pleased with Trump’s recommendation on assault weapons.Feinstein's reaction when Trump says she should add assault weapons ban to Manchin-Toomey pic.twitter.com/7dlKxwa1KO— Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) February 28, 2018",1
5,"Hundreds of students and community activists marched in protest of the inaction of lawmakers on the issue of gun violence, on February 23, 2018 in Tampa, Fla.Monica Herndon/ZUMABack in 2011, after a gunman in Tucson killed six people and wounded 13, including US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Americans took a fatalistic view of whether anything could be done to stop future mass shootings. A CNN poll at the time showed that voters believed by a 2-1 margin that there was nothing the government could do to prevent future attacks. Seven years later, that’s all changed. A new poll released by CNN on Sunday found that 64 percent of American voters now believe the government can “take action that will be effective” in preventing mass shootings in the future. Only 32 percent believe that such attacks will happen “regardless” of government action. The poll comes a week and a half after the Feb 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida left 17 dead.Here’s how the new numbers compare to poll results after previous mass shootings:if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""]={},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas={""100"":437,""200"":312,""300"":262,""400"":262,""500"":237,""700"":237,""800"":212,""900"":212,""1000"":212},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-xnxBM""),window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""xnxBM""==b)window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});What’s more, Americans are remarkably clear on exactly which steps they want the government to take. According to a separate poll released Sunday, conducted by USA Today/Suffolk University:Of course, just because people believe that government action would be effective, doesn’t mean they have confidence the government will act. Only about 1 in 5 respondents in the USA Today poll believe that Congress will take action on gun control: 28 percent of Republicans, and 14 percent of Democrats.Since the shooting, teen survivors of the tragedy continue to drum up national attention on the issue; the most famous of the bunch, Emma González, now has more Twitter followers than the National Rifle Association. But as Republican members of Congress return after a 10-day break, the Associated Press reports, they don’t appear to have much in the works. Even the most likely path forward—a modest bill to improve the accuracy of the federal background check system—has stalled, because it’s tied to a pro-gun plan to allow gun permits in one state to be recognized in all other states.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is earning some of his worst job approval marks of his presidency. Just 38 percent of voters currently approve of Trump’s job performance, the USA Today poll found—the lowest the president has ever scored, by their measure. According to Sunday’s CNN poll, Trump’s approval rating is down to 35 percent.",1
6,"Stop Mass Incarcerations Network sponsored a children's march demanding accountability on the one year anniversary of Tamir Rice's death at the hands of the Cleveland police. Andy Katz/APAfter the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last week, it quickly became clear that it wouldn’t be politicians or veteran activists leading the effort to demand action against gun violence—it would be students. Calls for action from the Stoneman Douglas students and their peers across the country have received an outpouring of support in the form of national attention and celebrity donations: Just this week, George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey each pledged to donate $500,000 to the March for Our Lives, a group “created and led” by kids to organize a national protest against gun violence on March 24 in Washington, D.C. George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’  These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.— Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) February 20, 2018Wednesday night, several Stoneman Douglas students stunned the nation by grilling elected officials and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch at a town hall. The following morning, Obama praised the young folks in a tweet: “How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We’ve been waiting for you.” But as Roxane Gay, a celebrated American writer, pointed out on Twitter, this is not the first time kids have been doing the hard work of political organizing and protest in the wake of trauma.  It is interesting to note the difference in support for the kids in FL versus the kids in Black Lives Matter. I say that with full admiration for the kids in FL, to survive such a trauma and fight for everyone to be safer. But that’s also what was happening in Ferguson and beyond— roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2018Gay is, of course, correct. Throughout history, kids from all backgrounds have been crucial in the fight for social justice. Child Labor ProtestsIn 1903, prominent labor organizer Mary Harris “Mother” Jones (who is also the namesake of this magazine) marched from Philadelphia to New York City with 400 “juvenile workers” to protest child labor in textile mills. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the “‘children’s army’…made frequent stops to give speeches and to show the public the effects of exploitation, as many of the children marching were permanently maimed, which provided real proof of the dangers of their employment.” Mother Jones and her “army” of textile workers on their march from Philadelphia to New York City to protest child labor.Library of Congress, Pierce & JonesA few years later, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York “passed the nation’s first true child labor laws,” the Inquirer reports. Teenagers and children played a major role throughout the civil rights movement. In 1955, before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., another young woman by the name of Claudette Colvin did the same thing—except she was 15 years old. After she was arrested and sent to jail, Colvin became one of the four plaintiffs in the Browder v. Gayle Supreme Court case, which ultimately desegregated buses in Alabama.In 1957, the governor of Arkansas dispatched the state national guard to prevent the students who went down in history as the Little Rock Nine from attending a newly integrated high school. President Eisenhower sent 1,200 soldiers to protect them later that month. In spite of daily threats and violence, the students attended the school for the full year.Less than a decade after that, thousands of children and teenagers protested segregation by marching across Birmingham, Ala., on May 2, 1963. Hundreds of black children were arrested and crowded into the local jails. The next day, on orders from a city official, police sprayed the children who continued to march with water hoses and hit them with batons. They kept going anyway.Over 1000 children and teens were arrested in protests on May 2, 1963 in Birmingham. The city ran out of jail space. pic.twitter.com/0GgWsfYseQ— Maria Chong (@mariachong) February 21, 2018“We didn’t hate white people,” Janice Wesley Kelsey, who was arrested at the protests when she was in 11th grade, recalled to The New Yorker. “We didn’t even know any. We hated the system. That’s what we were protesting about.”Eight days later, civil rights leaders announced that they had come to an agreement with city officials: Birmingham would desegregate businesses and release the detained protesters.Two months after that, President Kennedy took to national television to denounce segregation and propose new civil rights legislation.As Gay noted, children and teenagers have also been heavily involved in the Black Lives Matter movement since its inception. In 2014, for example, after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, black kids were heavily present in the protests that became a major turning point for the movement. Children watch from their home as people march to protest the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Many residents of the St. Louis suburb have said they feel like they are living in a war zone following the shooting of Michael Brown by police. Charlie Riedel / Associated PressParents across the country recognized the historical importance of the moment and wanted their children to bear witness.“It was important for them to be there,” Kendra Pierson, who brought her sons to an Atlanta vigil to honor Brown, told Huffington Post. “When they look back, in 10 years or five years, I want them to know they were there.” Pierson’s children were six and two years old at the time.Protester Janelle Pittman holds her 6-year-old daughter, Kat, as police in riot gear stand guard in Ferguson, Mo. on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014.Jeff Roberson / Associated Press.Their activism has continued on through the present.As demonstrators begin to gather, children and adults hold signs during a rally Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2014, in Charlotte, N.C. to protest the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer for the death of Michael Brown. John D.

This is amazing. And a I’m not being sarcastic. I have to be honest and say that I’m a bit taken aback (and a bit hurt) that those of us who were in the streets in the past five years for Black lives didn’t receive this type of reception or public support. https://t.co/HLYXTcVdfL— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018I promise y’all. I’m happy for these young people. I just know how so many young people have put their lives on the line over the past five years. We’re rarely compared to Freedom Riders and recipients of such public support. I shouldn’t be bothered, but I am.— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018NFL Anthem ProtestsIn 2016, NFL player Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem before football games to protest police brutality and the systemic oppression of people of color in the United States. Soon enough, high school and college students across the country were following his lead. Before tonight’s Oakland A’s game, the OUSD Honor Band played the national anthem. And because of the heated national debate over racial justice, the students decided to take a knee for the whole song. They said they were protesting racism, police brutality and President Trump for saying what he did about protesting @nfl players who take a knee. See the video on the OUSD Facebook page. #iamOUSDA post shared by  Oakland School District (@ousdnews) on Sep 25, 2017 at 9:13pm PDTIn January, the Washington Post published an op-ed in support of Kaepernick, penned by a class of fourth graders in New York City: The majority of Americans support these players. But you know what? Even more younger people than older people do. We believe this is because they are inspiring us by showing us their passion, and fighting for what’s right…The players are standing up — or kneeling down — to bring awareness to the problem of how African-Americans are treated in this country. Some police are not treating black people right — and there’s a long history to this. And it’s still happening now.Protests Against White Supremacy and the Far-Right Last spring,  far-right “lightning rod” Milo Yiannopoulos arrived at the invitation of the Berkeley College Republicans to give a talk on campus, chaos erupted. That night of protest set off a series of rallies, organized by far-right extremists and white supremacists. Young people nationwide showed up to counter-protest these rallies, which sometimes turned violent—in Charlottesville, a “Unite the Right” rally left one young woman dead and 19 people injured.These are literally young UVA students age 17-23 standing up to a sea of white supremacists and neo-Nazis surrounding them #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/VEU3mU9d3o— sophia_armen (@SophiaArmen) August 12, 2017In Berkeley, protests continued in August, when a small number of right-wing protesters were overwhelmed by thousands of peaceful counter-protesters.

7,"Phil Velasquez/ZUMAA day after thousands of students across the country participated in walk-outs to protest gun violence, former President Barack Obama on Thursday offered his support to the “fearless students” demanding lawmakers take action in response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida.Obama’s praise for the young activists came as top officials of the National Rifle Association, including president Wayne LaPierre, gathered at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in DC to warn that the recent calls to action were part of a “socialist wave.” During the event, Dana Loesch, a prominent spokeswoman for the gun lobby, also suggested that the media “loved” mass shootings.Young people have helped lead all our great movements.

And we've got your backs.— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 22, 2018While expressing his deep frustration after the failed efforts to enact stricter gun legislation in the wake of December 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Obama vowed that one day the country would “get this right.”“I believe we’re going to be able to get this done,” Obama said in 2013. “Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.”",1
8,"Students call for gun control outside the White House on Wednesday. Kara Voght/Mother JonesBusloads of teenagers arrived in Tallahassee overnight to continue their calls for gun control hundreds of miles from the site of a mass shooting that left 17 dead and 14 others injured at a Parkland, Fla. high school. On Wednesday, students from Parkland traveled to the state Capitol to meet with lawmakers and rally for changes to the state’s lax gun laws a day after the Florida House rejected a motion along party lines to take up a bill to ban assault rifles. Despite the setback, some students remain optimistic. Daniel Bishop, a student at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the New York Times that he thinks the shooting at his school represents a different moment than previous school shootings. “Sandy Hook, they were elementary kids who couldn’t stand up for themselves,” Bishop said. “Virginia Tech was 2007, a different time. But this one, I just have a gut feeling—something is going to change.” Over the next two weeks, the Republican-controlled legislature is expected to consider other proposals to bolster the state’s gun laws such as raising the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle to 21. Since the shooting last week, students have pressured lawmakers to act, led by members of “Never Again MSD,” a group of Stoneman Douglas students who say they will continue to call for expanded background checks and a ban on military-grade firearms. Florida Gov. Rick Scott is expected to meet with students at 5 p.m. today.  ""I did not wait out an hour, fearing for my life, just to watch yesterday, the horror of an overwhelming vote against a life-saving bill,"" student says https://t.co/Nn2QjsRD5R pic.twitter.com/Sd5cqpli1L— CBS News (@CBSNews) February 21, 2018""If we are going to protect our future, why are none of us protecting our children?"" student says.

Our goal is to ensure they are kept safe in the process.” Meanwhile, the head of Texas school district told parents in a letter that kids who decided to protest in the wake of the Florida shooting would face a three-day suspension, the Houston Chronicle reported. “Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,” Curtis Rhodes, superintendent of the Needville Independent School District, wrote. “We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved.”(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.12';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Thousands of high school students just walked out of class to demand tougher gun laws. ARE YOU LISTENING, Donald J. Trump??Posted by Mother Jones on Wednesday, February 21, 2018",1
9,"President Donald Trump was at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas on Wednesday visiting victims of Sunday’s mass shooting when a reporter asked him, “Do you think we have a gun violence problem?”“We’re not going to talk about that today,” Trump responded. “We won’t talk about that.”The day before, the White House had circulated talking points to Trump allies urging Republicans to resist new gun control measures that could arise in response to the massacre that left 59 dead and nearly 500 injured. “When it comes to gun control, let’s be clear: new laws won’t stop a mad man committed to harming innocent people,” the memo stated.Trump says he’ll discuss gun laws “as time goes on.” But everyone Mother Jones spoke with in Las Vegas the day of the president’s visit—on both sides of the debate—thinks the time for a conversation is now.On the northern fringe of the Vegas strip lies Las Vegas Gunfights, “a full contact gunfight arena” in which customers combine real guns, non-lethal ammo, and martial arts to battle each other in a warehouse with sand floors and stacks of barrels that can be used as weapons or for cover. “We’ve had six or seven guys knocked out this year,” says the owner—or, as he prefers, the “Commander of Chaos”—a former bounty hunter named Nephi Oliva. He said he’s an enigma to some people because he is an Afghan-American, born to a Muslim father and an American Mormon mother, who is an ardent Trump supporter and gun enthusiast. Still, he said, “While I support one particular viewpoint, we have other Americans who have other viewpoints, and their feelings are valid. They also want to be safe. And, frankly, I may disagree with them, but I also want them to be safe, too.”Standing in the entryway of the warehouse, where camouflage netting and gunfight posters drape the walls, Oliva said, “We can have these conversations now…This is a democracy.” He issued his own proposal for gun control: “First, take the guns away from the criminals—disarm them first. Then take the guns away from crooked police officers. Then take them away from crooked politicians, and tyrannical government officials. Once you’ve done all that, I will gladly hand my guns over.”Genghis Cohen, the owner of Machine Guns Vegas, where clients can shoot fully automatic Uzis and AK-47s and even fire off belt-fed machine guns from a helicopter, closed his range for two days following the massacre and voiced support for having frank discussions about gun regulation. “If we can change laws to make people safer, then why would we not do that?” he told the Guardian. “Someone’s got to say something because if we don’t we end up looking like a bunch of cockroaches scurrying for cover.”“Now is exactly the time,” Donna Waldron, 66, said at a rally for gun control at Las Vegas’ Sunset Park, where about 30 demonstrators gathered on Wednesday night. “On a sunny day, you don’t worry about the roof leaking. When the monsoon comes, you worry about the roof leaking. This is a monsoon of violence in our country. Sandy Hook, Charlottesville, Las Vegas, Texas—the gunning down of six police officers.”“If we have to wait until there isn’t a mass shooting to discuss this issue, we’ll be waiting forever,” said Jean Green Dunbar, 34, a Nevada state coordinator for the Women’s March on Washington who helped organize the rally. Last year, Dunbar canvassed for a ballot measure to enforce background checks on all gun sales. Nevada voters narrowly passed the measure, but state Republican leaders have continued to block its implementation. “Our attorney general, Adam Laxalt, refuses to enforce it,” Dunbar lamented. (In a speech at the NRA’s annual convention last April, Laxalt boasted of his role in opposing the measure’s passage and implementation.) “What we have in place, we need to enforce, and we can’t roll it back,” she said.Several gun owners showed up at the rally, including Waldron, who keeps her late husband’s pistol for protection, and Michael Hart, 69, who argued that a handgun or a regular rifle is perfectly sufficient to protect one’s home. “I think people should people be allowed to have guns,” he said, “but not military-style guns.”Several participants at the rally rejected the widespread perception that the gun debate breaks down along ideological lines, with liberals seeking tighter controls on guns and conservatives opposing them. “I have lots of family members that own weapons, that hunt, that are conservatives, that absolutely believe in gun control,” said Dunbar, adding, “We are not divided. Most Americans want these regulations.”According to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans from both major political parties support universal background checks, the creation of a federal database to track gun sales, and a ban on assault-style weapons.Even as the president and top Republican lawmakers in Washington remain reluctant to discuss the issue, there is bipartisan support for one new gun control measure: a bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would ban “bump stocks,” the type of device used by the Las Vegas gunman that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. On Wednesday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said he would likely support the legislation. “The fact that fully automatic weapons are already illegal and this makes another weapon capable [of automatic fire], I would be supportive of that,” he said. In an interview with Miami’s NPR affiliate, WLRN, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said, “Right now the best candidate for a common denominator is to focus on these bump stock devices, which are so deadly and so potent.” He added, “I’ve even spoken to people who are involved in the gun manufacturing business, and they have told me that these things should not be legal.”Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers have said they no longer expect a controversial bill that would deregulate gun silencers to come up for a full House vote. The legislation would remove silencers from the list of regulated items under the National Firearms Act of 1934, making their purchase subject only to an instant background check, or potentially to no regulation at all in states that don’t require background checks for private gun sales. On Tuesday morning, Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) told reporters, “I don’t think there’s any support to bring it up.”“A lot of people say they don’t want to roll back their Second Amendment rights,” said Deborah Johnson, one of the organizers of the gun control rally on Wednesday night. “Well, we don’t know how to control our Second Amendment rights. We abuse our Second Amendment rights. How many mass shootings have to happen before we have an honest conversation?”",1

Jonathan Mossberg wanted to be the Steve Jobs of firearms.In 1999, a few years before the invention of the iPod, Mossberg began to build the iGun, a computer-chip-equipped “smart gun” that could only be fired by its owner. (The “i” stands for intelligence.) He saw the technology as a commonsense way to prevent gun violence—a no-brainer safety device like seatbelts or air bags. The iGun is a shotgun equipped with a radio frequency identification (RFID) sensor that only allows it to be fired by someone wearing a special ring. By 2000, a fully functional version had endured a grueling round of military-grade testing and was ready to hit the market. “When I filed my patents, my patent attorney said, ‘You’ve got the next dot-com,'” Mossberg recalls. “He was blown away.”Mossberg wasn’t the first person to envision a smart gun, but he was well positioned to make it a reality. He was a scion of O.F. Mossberg & Sons, the nation’s oldest family-owned gun company, which makes one of the world’s best-selling lines of pump-action shotguns. He’d overseen manufacturing for the company and had also served as president of Uzi America, an importer of Israeli weapons.But the iGun hit a wall. Consumers were skeptical, in part because gun rights groups had been painting smart guns as a Trojan horse for gun grabbers. A few years earlier, gun manufacturer Colt had unveiled a smart-watch-activated pistol, and Smith & Wesson had pledged to explore “authorized user technology” for its weapons. Both projects were abandoned in the face of withering criticism from the National Rifle Association, which led a boycott of Smith & Wesson. In 2005, under pressure from the NRA, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, making gun manufacturers immune from lawsuits related to gun accidents or misuse—and removing another incentive to develop smart guns. (Today, the NRA says it doesn’t oppose smart guns but claims they are an attempt to make firearms more expensive and “would allow guns to be disabled remotely.”)Ever since, no major firearms maker has touched the smart-gun concept—including O.F. Mossberg & Sons. “They are doing so well that they have little to gain,” Mossberg says of his family’s company (which he left in 2000). Though they see the benefits of smart guns, “should this turn into a Smith & Wesson boycott-type thing, they don’t want to be associated with that. And I don’t blame them.”After shelving the iGun for more than a decade, Mossberg has reloaded. Americans’ trust in consumer electronics has grown, along with their concern about gun violence and safety. “The whole thing has gained a lot of momentum again,” says Mossberg, who today owns the exclusive rights to produce and market the iGun. He says he receives emails nearly every day asking about its price and availability.Silicon chips have shrunk to the point that Mossberg can produce a 9 mm handgun version of the iGun, tapping a much larger market. While O.F. Mossberg & Sons’ research once suggested that gun owners were skeptical of weapons containing circuit boards, a 2013 survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun manufacturers’ trade association, found that 14 percent of all gun owners were somewhat or very likely to buy smart guns. Though the NSSF spun those results as bad for smart guns, Mossberg sees an opportunity potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “I know lots of people who would love to get 14 percent of the firearms market,” he says. And new research shows the market could be much bigger. A nationally representative survey published by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in December found that nearly 60 percent of Americans, if they were to buy a new handgun, would be willing to purchase a smart gun.Police departments have also come around to the concept of issuing firearms that can’t be used by bad guys. More than 5 percent of officers killed in the line of duty are shot with their own weapons, often 9 mm handguns. In November, San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr told 60 Minutes that he wanted his officers to have the option to carry smart guns if they were available. More than a dozen law enforcement agencies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Florida have tested the iGun in recent months, according to Mossberg.Smart guns have also gained a powerful ally in Washington. In January, President Obama directed the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a strategy to promote smart gun research and expedite government procurement of the weapons.To bring a smart pistol to market, Mossberg says he needs to raise about $1 million for research and development—money that almost certainly won’t come from O.F. Mossberg & Sons or any other major firearms company. Following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway announced an effort to fund start-up companies dedicated to promoting gun safety. Conway’s Smart Tech Challenges Foundation gave Mossberg a grant of $100,000, which helped generate buzz for smart guns in the Valley. Yet nearly two years later, not a single venture capital firm has backed a smart-gun company. Margot Hirsch, the president of Smart Tech Challenges, says tech investors didn’t have smart guns on their radar in the past, but she hopes that now “the VC community and impact investors will be interested in investing, not only to make money, but to save lives.”Mossberg sees no reason why his product should be controversial. “In the 1700s and 1800s, there was still no manual safety device on a gun,” he observes, referring to the safety catches that are now ubiquitous on American handguns and rifles. “And then somebody put one on there and nobody cared. This is nothing more than that.”window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={""beacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""licenseKey"":""949ceaf672"",""applicationID"":""42428067"",""transactionName"":""MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMTD1VE"",""queueTime"":0,""applicationTime"":124,""atts"":""HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse"",""errorBeacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""agent"":""""}",1

In Orlando this afternoon, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with victims’ families and survivors of the massacre at the Pulse LGBT nightclub that claimed the lives of 49 people just days ago.Obama spoke about an increasingly urgent need for gun control legislation, saying “we need to work across political lines to do more to stop killers who want to terrorize us.”“The last two terrorist attacks on our soil—Orlando and San Bernardino—were homegrown,” he said. “Our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual…to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons…legally.”He insisted that the debate surrounding gun control needs to change, and called on the House and Senate to “rise to the moment and do the right thing” and pass legislation to curb access to weapons like the AR-15. “For so many [LGBT] people, the Pulse has been a safe haven…and on Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way possible,” Obama said. “Americans were targeted because we’re a country that’s learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.”Watch his remarks in full below:WATCH: President Obama’s full remarks after meeting with #Orlando shooting survivors and families of victims. https://t.co/qkyc0gPb3N	— ABC News (@ABC) June 16, 2016 ",1

Time will tell. But an interesting perspective on the question comes via the team over at Google Trends, who have been crunching the search giant’s internal numbers on searches related to guns. Take a look how searches—represented on the maps below as ranked search terms within Google—have evolved over the last year, and even in the wake of the Orlando massacre.Here’s the 2015 average for the search terms “Gun control” and “Gun shop,” with each state colored by whichever term had a higher average search rank:You can see that “Gun shop” was the higher search term in most states in 2015, but that was starting to change in 2016. Take a look: But that’s changed in a big way since Orlando, where searches for “Gun control” dominate in every state except Kentucky:The “gun control” search term might have had a bounce post-Orlando since it’s a natural topic of conversation and one of the major news topics over the last few days and it is unclear whether a massacre of 49 mostly LGBTQ innocent people has inspired the population to take gun control more seriously. But maybe something is changing. Google Trends also looked at the same type of search traffic in the wake of other mass shootings, including after Oregon, Virginia, and Charleston. In those cases, search traffic for “Gun control” spiked only after Oregon: ",1

15,"Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo at the March for Our Lives on March 24.David J. Phillip/APThe evening after a gunman killed 10 people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Houston police chief Art Acevedo took to Facebook to write an impassioned plea for gun control, writing that he had hit “rock bottom” after the massacre.“I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children,” Acevedo wrote in his post. “I know some have strong feelings about gun rights…I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue.”The Santa Fe High School shooting, 35 miles outside of Houston, is far from the first mass shooting to affect Texas cities in the past few years. Six months ago, 26 people were killed at the Texas First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. And in 2016, a gunman killed 5 police officers in Dallas. At least 99 people have died in 8 mass shootings in the state since 1984.Acevedo has called for stronger gun measures before, and on March 24 he joined in Houston’s March for Our Lives, one of many marches across the country spearheaded by teen survivors of the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.Here is his full Facebook post:To all my Facebook friends. Today I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children and a responding police officer who is clinging to life. I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve shed tears of sadness, pain and anger.I know some have strong feelings about gun rights but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue. Please do not post anything about guns aren’t the problem and there’s little we can do. My feelings won’t be hurt if you de-friend me and I hope yours won’t be if you decide to post about your views and I de-friend you.I have never accepted the status-quo in anything I do and I’ve never accepted defeat. And I won’t do it now.

Even as the National Rifle Association celebrates Donald Trump’s victory, gun control advocates have something to smile about today. Of the four gun-related measures on state ballots this year, three passed.The only gun-related ballot measure not to win, Question 3 asked voters whether background checks should be required for private gun sales. If neither the buyer nor the seller is a licensed gun dealer, they’d have to go to a licensed dealer who would run a background check. The measure would have also required a background check for loaning guns, with exceptions for gun transfers between family members, emergency self-defense, and temporary transfers for hunting and sport shooting. Supporters, including Maine Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense Fund and Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership Fund, have spent $5.2 million to get the measure passed. Approximately $1 million was spent against it, the vast majority by the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action.Prop 63 passed easily, garnering 63 percent of the vote. It will ban certain types of semi-automatic assault rifles, require background checks for ammunition sales, outlaw magazines that carry more than 10 bullets, create a system for confiscating guns from felons, and require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. Major components of the initiative already became law earlier this year, and gun rights groups say they will challenge the overlapping laws in court. Opponents spent nearly $1 million against the measure to the nearly $4.5 million spent by supporters.Similar to Maine’s ballot initiative, Question 1 will require most gun sales, including private sales, to be subject to a background check. However, it narrowly passed by less than 10,000 votes. The same exemptions that Maine allows also apply here. Supporters spent more than $18 million and received significant financial backing from Everytown For Gun Safety. The NRA Nevadans for Gun Freedom and Nevadans for State Gun Rights spent nearly $6.5 million to sink the initiative. The NRA stuck to its usual script in opposing the measure, writing, “Question 1 does nothing to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms.”Initiative 1491 allows family, household members, and police to petition a judge to temporarily prohibit a person’s access to guns if that person is found to be a risk to himself or others. Petitions for an “extreme risk protection order” will last one year. Those under order can request a hearing to argue against the order. The NRA opposed the measure, saying that “if a person is truly dangerous, existing law already provides a variety of mechanisms to deal with the individual.” Nonetheless, it passed with 71 percent of the vote.",1

On Monday, the Senate failed to move forward two gun control measures aimed at expanding background checks and blocking individuals listed on terrorist watch lists from obtaining weapons. This outcome was widely expected, even after a 15-hour marathon filibuster staged by Senate Democrats urging their fellow lawmakers to act on gun control in the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history.As Samantha Bee noted on the latest Full Frontal on Monday, Republicans including “rodent-faced soup sponge” Sen. Ted Cruz, have dismissed calls for increased gun control since the Orlando mass shooting as nothing more than a political game and political correctness staged by Democrats. Much of this, as Bee explained, is the result of the strong grip the National Rifle Association has on Republican lawmakers.

They announced nationwide marches for gun control next month and ripped politicians, including President Donald Trump, who benefit from the National Rifle Association’s political spending while refusing to act to strengthen gun laws.“Now is the time to get on the right side of this,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the students, said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “Because this is not something we are going to be let [you] sweep under the carpet.” Gonzalez said she was speaking directly to Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), and other lawmakers who have benefited from pro-gun money.“These people who are being funded by the NRA are not going to be allowed to remain in office when midterm elections roll around,” she said. “They are going to be voted out of office.”Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Alex Wind, and Jaclyn Corin are among the survivors of the shooting that killed 17 people at the high school on Wednesday. They drew praise from network and cable news hosts as they offered pointed advice for lawmakers and older Americans.On Sunday afternoon, the White House announced that Trump will hold what it called a listening session on gun violence with high school students this coming Wednesday. The White House did not say which students Trump would meet with or if he would speak with the students organizing the marches. Some Stoneman Douglas students and parents have said they don’t want to meet with Trump, the Daily Beast reported Friday.“We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” Kasky said on CNN’s State of the Union.“This is about us begging for our lives,” Kasky said. “This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about us creating a badge of shame for any politicians accepting money from the NRA and using us as collateral.”The students said they are planning are series of demonstrations called “March for Our Lives” that will take place around the country on March 24. It will include a rally in Washington. Other students are planning a nationwide school walkout on April  20—the 19th anniversary of the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado—to highlight lawmakers’ failure to address the problem.“We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks,” Gonzalez said during a speech at a rally on Saturday. “Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because…we are going to be the last mass shooting.”Other students from the school on Sunday criticized Trump for a tweet in which he blamed the the ongoing Russia probe for the FBI’s failure to act on warnings about the alleged gunman. Trump’s tweet drew widespread condemnation.",1
19,"Semi-automatic rifles line the walls of a gun shop in Lynnwood, Washington.Elaine Thompson/APThe day after a new poll revealed that 95 percent of American voters support universal background checks for gun purchases—a record high—a bi-partisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to improve the federal background check system.The measure would not mandate a background check for every gun sale. The “compromise” legislation, as the senators put it, would instead focus on requiring state and federal agencies to do a better job of entering criminal history records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), as is already required by law. The Fix NICS Act would penalize federal agencies that fail to properly input records and incentivize states to improve their overall reporting.The group of seven senators sponsoring the bill is led by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who has an A+ rating from the NRA, and includes four Republicans and three Democrats—Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), all prominent gun safety advocates.“It’s no secret that I believe much more needs to be done,” Sen. Murphy said in a statement on Thursday. “But this bill will make sure that thousands of dangerous people are prevented from buying guns. It represents the strongest update to the background checks system in a decade, and provides the foundation for more compromise in the future.”The bill was inspired by an apparent loophole that came to light in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at a baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 dead earlier this month. The shooter had a history of domestic abuse; as a member of the Air Force, he’d been court-martialed for two charges of domestic assault, sentenced to 12 months of confinement, and was kicked out of the military in 2014 with a Bad Conduct Discharge. Technically, his crimes prevented him from legally buying a gun, but the Air Force never submitted the criminal records for the the NICS database, allowing him to pass a background check and purchase a gun. It’s unclear how frequently this occurs, but the Trace found that it may be a much wider problem than this isolated incident.“Mass murderers in Sutherland Springs, Charleston, and Blacksburg were legally prohibited from accessing firearms, but gaps in NICS allowed each of them to walk out of a gun store with the weapons used to commit their crimes,” said Sen. Blumenthal. He told the New York Times, “It may seem to many like a baby step, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and this one could well be important in breaking the ice of complicity that has paralyzed Congress.”This isn’t the first time that lawmakers have introduced a law to force federal agencies to better comply with existing gun-control laws. In 2007, the House voted to close a loophole that allowed the Virginia Tech gunman to purchase weapons despite having been committed to a mental hospital. It provided grant money for states to update the background checks database, adding more criminal records and mental health information, and was similarly viewed as a compromise bill between lawmakers with opposing political views. A co-sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), said at the time, “This act will ensure that the background check system really is instant and accurate.” There has been improvement in reporting on both criminal backgrounds and mental health since then, but ten years and several mass shootings later shows there is still much to be done.",1
20,"Gerrymandering activists gather outside the Supreme Court in March. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via APThe Supreme Court dealt a big blow Monday to efforts to combat racial gerrymandering, approving Texas’ GOP-drawn political maps that had previously been found to discriminate intentionally against minority voters. In a 5-4 ruling, the court upheld the state’s congressional and legislative maps, with the exception of the map of one state legislative district, which the court struck down for reducing the voting power of minority groups. The court’s decision overturns the findings of the federal district court in Texas, which had found not only that the Legislature had discriminated against minorities in drawing certain districts, but also that the discrimination was an intentional effort to “ensure Anglo control.” But the court’s conservative majority disagreed, reversing the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination.Justice Sonia Sotomoyor issued a blistering dissent, joined by the other liberal justices. This decision “comes at serious costs to our democracy,” she wrote. “It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas—despite constituting a majority of the population within the State—will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.” The Texas case presented a quandary for the Supreme Court. In 2013, the court gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act, eliminating the ability of the federal government to block state and local election laws that discriminated against minorities. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the country had changed, and that the racism that had pervaded election practices since the civil rights movement had dissipated. Texas challenged that narrative. The state has lost nine racial discrimination voting cases since 2011, with multiple judges finding that the discrimination was intentional—including in the political maps at issue in this case.The court’s decision Monday is in keeping with its 2013 ruling. Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the majority “blinds itself to the overwhelming factual record…to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.”This latest battle over Texas’ political maps began shortly after the last redistricting period following the 2010 census. Texas’ population had ballooned over the previous decade due to the state’s rapidly expanding minority population, and nearly 90 percent of Texas’ 4.3 million new residents were Latino or African American. As the fastest-growing state, Texas received four new congressional districts. But when the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political maps the following year, it created four new districts that were largely controlled by white voters. Latino and African American rights groups sued over the new maps.A federal court blocked the 2011 maps and hastily put in place a tweaked version ahead of the 2012 elections for Congress and the state Legislature. These maps were intended to be temporary. But as soon as the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Texas Republicans simply passed these temporary maps as the state’s new permanent maps. Minority rights groups, including the Texas branch of the NAACP and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, challenged these maps, arguing that they retained the bias of the blocked 2011 maps they were based on. Last year, a district court in San Antonio agreed, finding in two separate rulings that the 2011 and 2013 maps intentionally discriminated by weakening the voting power of black and Latino voters.Conservative justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for the majority in Monday’s ruling. In upholding Texas’ maps, he found fault in the district court’s analysis. “Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State,” he wrote. “In redistricting cases, the ‘good faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.'”  The court’s ruling will allow the Republican-drawn maps to remain in place through the 2020 elections, until the next round of redistricting takes place following the census that year. But even then, it could shape the next decade’s maps: The court’s ruling will likely be seen as an open invitation for Republicans to continue to weaken the voting power of minority, Democratic-leaning voters in Texas and across the country. ",1
21,"Brian Cahn/ZUMAPresident Donald Trump on Monday falsely accused Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) of attempting to incite violence against his supporters, warning the California lawmaker to “be careful what you wish for.” He also viciously branded Waters as being an “extremely low IQ person.”Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018The president’s tweet is a blatant misrepresentation of Waters’ actual comments, in which she recently urged Democrats to confront Trump administration officials in public with words of protest, not violence. “Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up,” Waters said at a rally in Los Angeles Saturday. “And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.”“Tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” she said, before speaking out against Trump’s immigration policy separating migrant children from their parents.Conservatives instantly seized on the remarks, which came amid a recent spate of public protests against Trump officials inside privately owned restaurants. The latest involved White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday, when the owner of a Lexington, Virginia, restaurant asked her to leave over the Trump administration’s “inhumane” policies.Adding to the misrepresentations Monday, Trump also appeared to accuse House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of supporting Waters’ remarks moments after Pelosi did exactly the opposite.In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again. Trump’s daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable. As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea. https://t.co/vlpqOBLK4R— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 25, 2018",1
22,"Harley Rouda for CongressDemocratic congressional candidate Harley Rouda will challenge incumbent Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher this November in an attempt to flip California’s 48th Congressional district from red to blue. Rouda’s competitor, stem cell scientist Hans Kierstead, has conceded the second place spot in California’s “top-two” primary to Rouda, according to Rouda’s Twitter account.The concession comes after a weekslong, and yet still unfinished, vote count by the Orange County Registrar of Voters. In the days immediately following the election, Kierstead held a narrow lead over Rouda, a real estate investor. As OC workers slowly worked their way through the ballots, Rouda gained on, and eventually surpassed, Kierstead. As of Sunday, Rouda held a 126 vote lead over Kierstead.  I just got off the phone with @drhanskeirstead. We congratulated each other on a hard fought primary and he pledged his full support to our campaign to #flipthe48th and defeat @RepRohrabacher. #ThankYouHans— Harley Rouda (@HarleyRouda) June 25, 2018As in six other Republican-held districts across California, more residents of Rohrabacher’s south Orange County district supported Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Demographically, the district has a slight white majority, but about 40 percent of the its residents are either Latino or Asian. Its median annual household income is a healthy $89,000.Heading into the June 5 primary, many worried that California’s uncommon top-two “jungle primary”—where the top-two primary vote-getters, regardless of party, duke it out in the November general election—could conceivably have lead to Democrats getting locked out of the November general election.That didn’t happen. On June 6, Democrats let out a sigh of relief as it became clear they had avoided a lock-out in all the in-play districts. But in California’s 48th, the question of which Democrat would advance wasn’t clear until 19 days after the election.Though Rouda will likely tap broad Democratic financial support on his path to the November general election, his primary victory is basically the result a coin flip. The California State Democratic Party voted in February to endorse Keirstead, but the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) opted to spend money boosting Rouda in the days before the primary election.Incidentally, the DCCC also spent more than $100,000 boosting a lower polling Republican candidate John Gabbard, presumably to siphon votes away from another, stronger candidate Scott Baugh, to decrease the likelihood of Democrats getting shut out of the November general election, according to Open Secrets.In the primary, both Rouda and Keirstead ran on progressive platforms. If elected, Rouda has pledged to advocate for Medicare for all.",1
23,"February 21, 2018 - Washington, District of Columbia - Students from the DC area walk out of class to demand gun control legislation at a gathering outside the White House. Erin Scott/ZUMA WireFollowing the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month, all eyes are on the students who have garnered an unprecedented amount of national attention from their calls for gun control. In the couple of weeks since the shooting, the students have grilled politicians on live television, mocked conspiracy theorists on Twitter, and inspired hundreds of people across the country to demand action from their state legislators and from Washington.Three major national protests are already in the works and will take place over the next few months, adding to a regular stream of local activism. Here’s a look at what to expect:March 14: “Enough” national school walk outWith leadership from the Women’s March organizers, students and teachers across the country are planning “Enough“—a national school walkout scheduled for March 14.According to the event’s Facebook page, the walk out will begin at 10 a.m. in each time zone and last for 17 minutes, one minute for every victim who died in the Parkland shooting; 33,000 people have RSVP-ed on Facebook that they will attend. Dozens of schools are listed on the Enough homepage as participating.“We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns. Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that address the public health crisis of gun violence,” the organizers write on the march’s homepage. “We want Congress to pay attention and take note: many of us will vote this November and many others will join in 2020.”March 24: March For Our LivesTen days later, on March 24, the “March For Our Lives” will descend on Washington, D.C. The organizing for this rally began with survivors of the Parkland shooting but now involves students nationwide. Their goal is to demand that a “comprehensive and effective bill be immediately” introduced in Congress to address gun violence. “March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,” the organizers write on their website. “In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut short in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March For Our Lives believes the time is now.” This march gained additional notoriety last week when celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and George Clooney each promised to donate $500,000 to the march. According to the Washington Post, organizers expect nearly 500,000 attendees in Washington. There will also be dozens of sister marches across the country. April 20: National High School WalkoutOn the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, another national walk out will take place—this one organized by Lane Murdock, a 15 year-old high school student in Connecticut, to protest gun violence in schools and inaction by lawmakers.Murdock created a petition on Change.org to publicize the walk-out: “Public school shootings affect communities and especially teenagers,” she wrote. “On February, 14th a High School shooting in Parkland, Florida occurred, killing 17 people. Still, POTUS has not addressed any form of gun legislation. The majority of teenagers have no right to vote, leaving our voice unheard.” Around 200,000 people have signed the petition online, committing to walk out of their schools on April 20, and teachers across the country are planning to join. According to the Hartford Courant, students will also stand in silence for 17 minutes for each victim of the tragedy. Are there other protests being planned, perhaps in your local area?

24,"Oliver Contreras/SIPA USA via APPresident Trump is finally talking about gun control three days after a mass shooting that left 17 people dead and injured at least 14 others at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The president was silent about the issue in a speech at the White House on Thursday, where he offered condolences to the families of the students and teachers murdered and said he would meet with lawmakers and others to discuss school safety. He also visited victims and their families in Broward County on Friday. On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted:Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018In terms of partisan politics, tighter gun regulations have long been much more favored by Democrats than Republicans, but two gun control measures failed to pass in the Senate in 2013, when Democrats held the majority.

25,"Jose Luis Magana/APOne month after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students from across the country walked out of class to protest Congress’ inaction on gun violence. And as they did, Congress responded—sort of. With teenagers demonstrating outside the Capitol, both the House and Senate on Wednesday made vague efforts to deal with school safety issues, holding votes and hearings that attempted to address the matter without actually tightening gun laws.Fix this before I text my mom from under a desk #NationalSchoolWalkout pic.twitter.com/bk820wL7Kt— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018In the House, members voted to pass the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that reauthorizes a 2001 Justice Department program designed to prevent school violence. It provides $50 million in federal funding to help schools train staff in identifying mental health issues and violent behavior; establish an anonymous reporting system; and pay for school security measures, such as metal detectors and locks. The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, includes no gun-related provisions. And while it received overwhelming bipartisan support―only 10 members opposed it―Democrats have sharply criticized GOP lawmakers for not doing more to curtail access to guns.The bill represents the first major vote on school safety since the February shooting in Parkland, but it was not originally a reaction to the massacre. A bipartisan group of lawmakers―including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), who represents Parkland―introduced the bill at the end of January, and it had received support from anti-school-violence groups at that time. Deutch told Politico that “it is in no way a response to Stoneman Douglas and does not address the gun violence epidemic in our country.” Following the shooting, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced companion legislation in the Senate, where it was met with similarly broad, bipartisan support.Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2018In the Senate, the Judiciary committee held a hearing Wednesday to investigate the failures of federal authorities to effectively respond to warning signs displayed by the Florida gunman. Senators took the opportunity to grill FBI Acting Deputy Director David Bowdich on the White House’s gun and school safety proposals and to ask about other potential reform measures. Bowdich―who’s held the job since the end of January, following the resignation of Andrew McCabe―seemed to leave at least some lawmakers unsatisfied.For example, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) brought up Trump’s proposal for arming teachers and pointed to research showing that harsh school discipline often disproportionately affects students of color. When Harris asked Bowdich if the White House plan would include implicit bias training designed to prevent teachers from shooting innocent students, Bowdich said, “I never really put the two together.”Officials from the Secret Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives received a similar reception from lawmakers when they failed to answer questions about the efficacy of student risk assessments and background checks for gun sales. And incredibly, none of the three executive branch representatives were familiar with the Dickey Amendment, federal legislation that prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding public health research into gun violence.Members of the Parkland community also weighed in at the hearing, including Stoneman Douglas teacher Katherine Posada and Ryan Petty, the father of a student killed in the shooting. Petty urged Congress to follow the example of lawmakers in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott (R) just signed a package of bipartisan gun restrictions over the objections of the National Rifle Association. The Florida legislation established a three-day waiting period for gun sales, raised the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21, and provided $400 million for mental health services and school safety resources, such as bulletproof glass and metal detectors. Petty said he hopes to spend Thursday meeting with Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss how the parties could find common ground on the issue.The march is on the way to the Capitol building #nationalschoolwalkout pic.twitter.com/KdeOuCnVcY— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018Despite the calls from students and activists across the country, no gun control measures have gained any traction in Congress in the month since the Parkland shooting—repeating a pattern that has persisted since the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. As that stalemate continues, Congress’ school safety conversations will proceed. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) says the House plans to hold its own oversight hearing on the FBI’s failures to investigate the Florida gunman prior to the shooting. And next week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is expected to appear before two House committees to discuss the White House’s plans to address gun violence.",1
26,"Royce Christensen, Las Vegas massacre survivor, attends his first gun safety rally.Mother Jones/Al Kamalizad“Damn!” says Royce Christensen, 22, beaming at his mother, Darla, as they troop through Saturday’s March for Our Lives demonstration in Salt Lake City, Utah. They make their way along the route from West High School to the steps of the state Capitol building, and the crowd chants, “Vote them out!” It’s a huge turnout. “And this is a red state!” Christensen exclaims.“Imagine what D.C. is like,” replies Darla.“Yeah,” Christensen nods. “D.C.”Royce wore a T-shirt to the march that identifies who he is: “Survivor,” it reads. “#VegasStrong.” Nearly six months ago, Royce and several members of his family were working as security guards at the Route 91 musical festival in Las Vegas when a barrage of bullets rained down in what would come to be known as the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Royce felt the bullets zipping overhead, kicking up shards of aluminum as they hit the stage. He saw people drop.And so on the cusp of the half-year anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre, we traveled with Christensen and his family as they drove north from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah, where they met up with Christensen’s fiancé to attend the March for Our Lives rally. It’s the first political rally that Christensen has ever marched in. On the drive up, he had said he wanted to “make something happen” after the Vegas shooting, and when he saw “the opportunity join something that seems to actually be gaining traction, that seems to be gripping onto the steps of the government for once,” he had to be part of it.He began the morning “ready for this,” but also nervous. He’d heard that there would be a counter-protest and that some of those demonstrators would be carrying weapons. He was also nervous that his ideas about gun control wouldn’t entirely align with those expressed at the rally. He’s had fun target shooting in the past. He doesn’t want the Second Amendment abolished. On the one hand, “Guns are awesome,” he says. On the other: “They need to be controlled.”Mother Jones first met Christensen two days after the Las Vegas massacre last October at a candlelit vigil, where he told the story of how he had tried to keep people calm and hidden as the gunfire blared on. When it was finally over, thousands of bullets and 10 long minutes later, he saw a truck, its bed filled with the wounded, speeding toward a hospital. The concert ground was “a maze of bodies.”“As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now.”Christensen wasn’t hit with a bullet during the Las Vegas massacre, but he’s been suffering ever since. He has a hard time sleeping, and when he does, his sleep is filled with nightmares. Tall buildings and balconies that someone could fire from make him nervous. When a car backfires or someone lights fireworks—not uncommon occurrences in Las Vegas, where he lives—he reacts, diving behind his bed or running through the house, switching off lights and pulling down blinds. He takes medicine for post-traumatic stress and sees a therapist at least once a week. Christensen has the rare gift of photographic memory, but nowadays, it feels like a curse. “As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now,” he says.At the rally, there’s a booming crowd of “people who care about what has happened,” he says. “I thought maybe 30, 50 people [would show up]. I think this is at least 400 people already. I did not think this many would show up at all.”He’s looked at the signs people carry and has listened to their goals for gun safety, and their fight for gun control doesn’t feel too extreme for him.”These people want common sense changes,” he says. “They don’t want to get rid of the Second Amendment.”If the counter-protestors are here with their guns, he doesn’t see them.As protesters chant, “Enough is enough!” and “Never Again!” he chants with them. When he meets other attendees, he introduces himself as a “proud survivor of the worst mass shooting in modern American history” and tells them that he’s marching with the hope that there will never be a new “worst mass shooting” again.Once the march reaches the Capitol building, Royce sits with his fiancé and his mother on the steps, facing a crowd that has grown to 8,000 people. While they listen to speeches from the student organizers, he and Darla lock eyes, and Darla weeps.After the last speech ends and the plaza clears, Christensen remains on the steps, awestruck. “I have not seen this kind of motivation before,” he says. “This is something new; I can feel it in the air.”Prior to the trip to Salt Lake City, Christensen sent a note to Mother Jones, full with anger, but also hope: “Pardon my French but when the worst shooting in United States history happened absolutely fucking nothing was done. When the church shooting that soon followed again absolutely nothing happened government-wise. Now after the Florida school shooting a large outcry is finally loud enough and has the staying power. I want to make sure that everyone remembers all the lives lost. I think this time these kids might change the world.”Now, after the rally, he’s even more hopeful and motivated. “This is change coming.”",1
27,"During a televised meeting with Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House, President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to broadly support a wide range of initiatives aimed at preventing future mass shootings. They ranged from endorsing stronger background checks to implementing “offensive” capabilities inside schools.One of the most striking moments came when it became increasingly clear that Trump was unfamiliar with the contents of the Manchin-Toomey bill, which famously failed to pass the Senate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. The 2013 legislation, which focused on expanding background checks and was strongly supported by then-President Barack Obama, marks the closest Congress has come in recent years to passing meaningful gun-control legislation. The speech Obama gave in response to the bill’s failure is regarded as his angriest public display. But on Wednesday, Trump appeared to blame his predecessor for the bill’s failure. It was just one of several times the president seemed to suggest that Obama didn’t push hard enough on gun control while in office. Trump also accused Toomey, who was in the room for Wednesday’s meeting, of being “afraid of the NRA” for not including language to raise the minimum age to purchase certain weapons.Sen. Pat Toomey tells President Trump that the Manchin-Toomey bill doesn’t deal with raising age limits from 18 to 21 to buy certain weapons.Trump: “You know why, because you are afraid of the NRA” https://t.co/vGNDzAlLt0— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 28, 2018At another point, Trump said he supported illegally seizing firearms from potential killers first, and then dealing with the due process. “I like taking the guns early,” he said in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s suggestion to do the exact opposite.WATCH: President Trump: ""I like taking the guns early … Take the guns first, go through due process second."" pic.twitter.com/aydEZdAGq0— NBC News (@NBCNews) February 28, 2018Trump later raised eyebrows when he suggested that a ban on assault weapons should also be included in the Manchin-Toomey bill. The surprising proposal was reminiscent of the January meeting at which lawmakers from both parties came together with the president to talk about immigration, and Trump agreed with Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s push for a clean bill on DACA. (Trump, of course, quickly backtracked, and later sought to kill a bipartisan bill many observers considered Congress’ best shot at a DACA resolution.)Nevertheless, Feinstein, who was sitting next to Trump at Wednesday’s meeting, looked quite pleased with Trump’s recommendation on assault weapons.Feinstein's reaction when Trump says she should add assault weapons ban to Manchin-Toomey pic.twitter.com/7dlKxwa1KO— Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) February 28, 2018",1

Gabrielle Giffords, Americans took a fatalistic view of whether anything could be done to stop future mass shootings. A CNN poll at the time showed that voters believed by a 2-1 margin that there was nothing the government could do to prevent future attacks. Seven years later, that’s all changed. A new poll released by CNN on Sunday found that 64 percent of American voters now believe the government can “take action that will be effective” in preventing mass shootings in the future. Only 32 percent believe that such attacks will happen “regardless” of government action. The poll comes a week and a half after the Feb 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida left 17 dead.Here’s how the new numbers compare to poll results after previous mass shootings:if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""]={},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas={""100"":437,""200"":312,""300"":262,""400"":262,""500"":237,""700"":237,""800"":212,""900"":212,""1000"":212},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-xnxBM""),window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""xnxBM""==b)window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});What’s more, Americans are remarkably clear on exactly which steps they want the government to take. According to a separate poll released Sunday, conducted by USA Today/Suffolk University:Of course, just because people believe that government action would be effective, doesn’t mean they have confidence the government will act. Only about 1 in 5 respondents in the USA Today poll believe that Congress will take action on gun control: 28 percent of Republicans, and 14 percent of Democrats.Since the shooting, teen survivors of the tragedy continue to drum up national attention on the issue; the most famous of the bunch, Emma González, now has more Twitter followers than the National Rifle Association. But as Republican members of Congress return after a 10-day break, the Associated Press reports, they don’t appear to have much in the works. Even the most likely path forward—a modest bill to improve the accuracy of the federal background check system—has stalled, because it’s tied to a pro-gun plan to allow gun permits in one state to be recognized in all other states.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is earning some of his worst job approval marks of his presidency. Just 38 percent of voters currently approve of Trump’s job performance, the USA Today poll found—the lowest the president has ever scored, by their measure. According to Sunday’s CNN poll, Trump’s approval rating is down to 35 percent.",1

Andy Katz/APAfter the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last week, it quickly became clear that it wouldn’t be politicians or veteran activists leading the effort to demand action against gun violence—it would be students. Calls for action from the Stoneman Douglas students and their peers across the country have received an outpouring of support in the form of national attention and celebrity donations: Just this week, George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey each pledged to donate $500,000 to the March for Our Lives, a group “created and led” by kids to organize a national protest against gun violence on March 24 in Washington, D.C. George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’  These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.— Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) February 20, 2018Wednesday night, several Stoneman Douglas students stunned the nation by grilling elected officials and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch at a town hall. The following morning, Obama praised the young folks in a tweet: “How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We’ve been waiting for you.” But as Roxane Gay, a celebrated American writer, pointed out on Twitter, this is not the first time kids have been doing the hard work of political organizing and protest in the wake of trauma.  It is interesting to note the difference in support for the kids in FL versus the kids in Black Lives Matter. I say that with full admiration for the kids in FL, to survive such a trauma and fight for everyone to be safer. But that’s also what was happening in Ferguson and beyond— roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2018Gay is, of course, correct. Throughout history, kids from all backgrounds have been crucial in the fight for social justice. Child Labor ProtestsIn 1903, prominent labor organizer Mary Harris “Mother” Jones (who is also the namesake of this magazine) marched from Philadelphia to New York City with 400 “juvenile workers” to protest child labor in textile mills. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the “‘children’s army’…made frequent stops to give speeches and to show the public the effects of exploitation, as many of the children marching were permanently maimed, which provided real proof of the dangers of their employment.” Mother Jones and her “army” of textile workers on their march from Philadelphia to New York City to protest child labor.Library of Congress, Pierce & JonesA few years later, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York “passed the nation’s first true child labor laws,” the Inquirer reports. Teenagers and children played a major role throughout the civil rights movement. In 1955, before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., another young woman by the name of Claudette Colvin did the same thing—except she was 15 years old. After she was arrested and sent to jail, Colvin became one of the four plaintiffs in the Browder v. Gayle Supreme Court case, which ultimately desegregated buses in Alabama.In 1957, the governor of Arkansas dispatched the state national guard to prevent the students who went down in history as the Little Rock Nine from attending a newly integrated high school. President Eisenhower sent 1,200 soldiers to protect them later that month. In spite of daily threats and violence, the students attended the school for the full year.Less than a decade after that, thousands of children and teenagers protested segregation by marching across Birmingham, Ala., on May 2, 1963. Hundreds of black children were arrested and crowded into the local jails. The next day, on orders from a city official, police sprayed the children who continued to march with water hoses and hit them with batons. They kept going anyway.Over 1000 children and teens were arrested in protests on May 2, 1963 in Birmingham. The city ran out of jail space. pic.twitter.com/0GgWsfYseQ— Maria Chong (@mariachong) February 21, 2018“We didn’t hate white people,” Janice Wesley Kelsey, who was arrested at the protests when she was in 11th grade, recalled to The New Yorker. “We didn’t even know any. We hated the system. That’s what we were protesting about.”Eight days later, civil rights leaders announced that they had come to an agreement with city officials: Birmingham would desegregate businesses and release the detained protesters.Two months after that, President Kennedy took to national television to denounce segregation and propose new civil rights legislation.As Gay noted, children and teenagers have also been heavily involved in the Black Lives Matter movement since its inception. In 2014, for example, after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, black kids were heavily present in the protests that became a major turning point for the movement. Children watch from their home as people march to protest the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Many residents of the St. Louis suburb have said they feel like they are living in a war zone following the shooting of Michael Brown by police. Charlie Riedel / Associated PressParents across the country recognized the historical importance of the moment and wanted their children to bear witness.“It was important for them to be there,” Kendra Pierson, who brought her sons to an Atlanta vigil to honor Brown, told Huffington Post. “When they look back, in 10 years or five years, I want them to know they were there.” Pierson’s children were six and two years old at the time.Protester Janelle Pittman holds her 6-year-old daughter, Kat, as police in riot gear stand guard in Ferguson, Mo. on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014.Jeff Roberson / Associated Press.Their activism has continued on through the present.As demonstrators begin to gather, children and adults hold signs during a rally Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2014, in Charlotte, N.C. to protest the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer for the death of Michael Brown. John D.

The school, which is less than 5 percent black, has received some backlash, but school officials say they’ve received overwhelming support from the community. Lisa Rathke / Associated PressAfter Oprah Winfrey tweeted that she would be donating $500,000 to the “March For Our Lives,” Charlene Carruthers, national director of Black Youth Project 100, tweeted her support and made a point similar to Gay’s. Gosh. This is amazing. And a I’m not being sarcastic. I have to be honest and say that I’m a bit taken aback (and a bit hurt) that those of us who were in the streets in the past five years for Black lives didn’t receive this type of reception or public support. https://t.co/HLYXTcVdfL— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018I promise y’all. I’m happy for these young people. I just know how so many young people have put their lives on the line over the past five years. We’re rarely compared to Freedom Riders and recipients of such public support. I shouldn’t be bothered, but I am.— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018NFL Anthem ProtestsIn 2016, NFL player Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem before football games to protest police brutality and the systemic oppression of people of color in the United States. Soon enough, high school and college students across the country were following his lead. Before tonight’s Oakland A’s game, the OUSD Honor Band played the national anthem. And because of the heated national debate over racial justice, the students decided to take a knee for the whole song. They said they were protesting racism, police brutality and President Trump for saying what he did about protesting @nfl players who take a knee. See the video on the OUSD Facebook page. #iamOUSDA post shared by  Oakland School District (@ousdnews) on Sep 25, 2017 at 9:13pm PDTIn January, the Washington Post published an op-ed in support of Kaepernick, penned by a class of fourth graders in New York City: The majority of Americans support these players. But you know what? Even more younger people than older people do. We believe this is because they are inspiring us by showing us their passion, and fighting for what’s right…The players are standing up — or kneeling down — to bring awareness to the problem of how African-Americans are treated in this country. Some police are not treating black people right — and there’s a long history to this. And it’s still happening now.Protests Against White Supremacy and the Far-Right Last spring,  far-right “lightning rod” Milo Yiannopoulos arrived at the invitation of the Berkeley College Republicans to give a talk on campus, chaos erupted. That night of protest set off a series of rallies, organized by far-right extremists and white supremacists. Young people nationwide showed up to counter-protest these rallies, which sometimes turned violent—in Charlottesville, a “Unite the Right” rally left one young woman dead and 19 people injured.These are literally young UVA students age 17-23 standing up to a sea of white supremacists and neo-Nazis surrounding them #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/VEU3mU9d3o— sophia_armen (@SophiaArmen) August 12, 2017In Berkeley, protests continued in August, when a small number of right-wing protesters were overwhelmed by thousands of peaceful counter-protesters.

31,"Students call for gun control outside the White House on Wednesday. Kara Voght/Mother JonesBusloads of teenagers arrived in Tallahassee overnight to continue their calls for gun control hundreds of miles from the site of a mass shooting that left 17 dead and 14 others injured at a Parkland, Fla. high school. On Wednesday, students from Parkland traveled to the state Capitol to meet with lawmakers and rally for changes to the state’s lax gun laws a day after the Florida House rejected a motion along party lines to take up a bill to ban assault rifles. Despite the setback, some students remain optimistic. Daniel Bishop, a student at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the New York Times that he thinks the shooting at his school represents a different moment than previous school shootings. “Sandy Hook, they were elementary kids who couldn’t stand up for themselves,” Bishop said. “Virginia Tech was 2007, a different time. But this one, I just have a gut feeling—something is going to change.” Over the next two weeks, the Republican-controlled legislature is expected to consider other proposals to bolster the state’s gun laws such as raising the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle to 21. Since the shooting last week, students have pressured lawmakers to act, led by members of “Never Again MSD,” a group of Stoneman Douglas students who say they will continue to call for expanded background checks and a ban on military-grade firearms. Florida Gov. Rick Scott is expected to meet with students at 5 p.m. today.  ""I did not wait out an hour, fearing for my life, just to watch yesterday, the horror of an overwhelming vote against a life-saving bill,"" student says https://t.co/Nn2QjsRD5R pic.twitter.com/Sd5cqpli1L— CBS News (@CBSNews) February 21, 2018""If we are going to protect our future, why are none of us protecting our children?"" student says.

Our goal is to ensure they are kept safe in the process.” Meanwhile, the head of Texas school district told parents in a letter that kids who decided to protest in the wake of the Florida shooting would face a three-day suspension, the Houston Chronicle reported. “Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,” Curtis Rhodes, superintendent of the Needville Independent School District, wrote. “We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved.”(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.12';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Thousands of high school students just walked out of class to demand tougher gun laws. ARE YOU LISTENING, Donald J. Trump??Posted by Mother Jones on Wednesday, February 21, 2018",1
32,"President Donald Trump was at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas on Wednesday visiting victims of Sunday’s mass shooting when a reporter asked him, “Do you think we have a gun violence problem?”“We’re not going to talk about that today,” Trump responded. “We won’t talk about that.”The day before, the White House had circulated talking points to Trump allies urging Republicans to resist new gun control measures that could arise in response to the massacre that left 59 dead and nearly 500 injured. “When it comes to gun control, let’s be clear: new laws won’t stop a mad man committed to harming innocent people,” the memo stated.Trump says he’ll discuss gun laws “as time goes on.” But everyone Mother Jones spoke with in Las Vegas the day of the president’s visit—on both sides of the debate—thinks the time for a conversation is now.On the northern fringe of the Vegas strip lies Las Vegas Gunfights, “a full contact gunfight arena” in which customers combine real guns, non-lethal ammo, and martial arts to battle each other in a warehouse with sand floors and stacks of barrels that can be used as weapons or for cover. “We’ve had six or seven guys knocked out this year,” says the owner—or, as he prefers, the “Commander of Chaos”—a former bounty hunter named Nephi Oliva. He said he’s an enigma to some people because he is an Afghan-American, born to a Muslim father and an American Mormon mother, who is an ardent Trump supporter and gun enthusiast. Still, he said, “While I support one particular viewpoint, we have other Americans who have other viewpoints, and their feelings are valid. They also want to be safe. And, frankly, I may disagree with them, but I also want them to be safe, too.”Standing in the entryway of the warehouse, where camouflage netting and gunfight posters drape the walls, Oliva said, “We can have these conversations now…This is a democracy.” He issued his own proposal for gun control: “First, take the guns away from the criminals—disarm them first. Then take the guns away from crooked police officers. Then take them away from crooked politicians, and tyrannical government officials. Once you’ve done all that, I will gladly hand my guns over.”Genghis Cohen, the owner of Machine Guns Vegas, where clients can shoot fully automatic Uzis and AK-47s and even fire off belt-fed machine guns from a helicopter, closed his range for two days following the massacre and voiced support for having frank discussions about gun regulation. “If we can change laws to make people safer, then why would we not do that?” he told the Guardian. “Someone’s got to say something because if we don’t we end up looking like a bunch of cockroaches scurrying for cover.”“Now is exactly the time,” Donna Waldron, 66, said at a rally for gun control at Las Vegas’ Sunset Park, where about 30 demonstrators gathered on Wednesday night. “On a sunny day, you don’t worry about the roof leaking. When the monsoon comes, you worry about the roof leaking. This is a monsoon of violence in our country. Sandy Hook, Charlottesville, Las Vegas, Texas—the gunning down of six police officers.”“If we have to wait until there isn’t a mass shooting to discuss this issue, we’ll be waiting forever,” said Jean Green Dunbar, 34, a Nevada state coordinator for the Women’s March on Washington who helped organize the rally. Last year, Dunbar canvassed for a ballot measure to enforce background checks on all gun sales. Nevada voters narrowly passed the measure, but state Republican leaders have continued to block its implementation. “Our attorney general, Adam Laxalt, refuses to enforce it,” Dunbar lamented. (In a speech at the NRA’s annual convention last April, Laxalt boasted of his role in opposing the measure’s passage and implementation.) “What we have in place, we need to enforce, and we can’t roll it back,” she said.Several gun owners showed up at the rally, including Waldron, who keeps her late husband’s pistol for protection, and Michael Hart, 69, who argued that a handgun or a regular rifle is perfectly sufficient to protect one’s home. “I think people should people be allowed to have guns,” he said, “but not military-style guns.”Several participants at the rally rejected the widespread perception that the gun debate breaks down along ideological lines, with liberals seeking tighter controls on guns and conservatives opposing them. “I have lots of family members that own weapons, that hunt, that are conservatives, that absolutely believe in gun control,” said Dunbar, adding, “We are not divided. Most Americans want these regulations.”According to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans from both major political parties support universal background checks, the creation of a federal database to track gun sales, and a ban on assault-style weapons.Even as the president and top Republican lawmakers in Washington remain reluctant to discuss the issue, there is bipartisan support for one new gun control measure: a bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would ban “bump stocks,” the type of device used by the Las Vegas gunman that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. On Wednesday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said he would likely support the legislation. “The fact that fully automatic weapons are already illegal and this makes another weapon capable [of automatic fire], I would be supportive of that,” he said. In an interview with Miami’s NPR affiliate, WLRN, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said, “Right now the best candidate for a common denominator is to focus on these bump stock devices, which are so deadly and so potent.” He added, “I’ve even spoken to people who are involved in the gun manufacturing business, and they have told me that these things should not be legal.”Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers have said they no longer expect a controversial bill that would deregulate gun silencers to come up for a full House vote. The legislation would remove silencers from the list of regulated items under the National Firearms Act of 1934, making their purchase subject only to an instant background check, or potentially to no regulation at all in states that don’t require background checks for private gun sales. On Tuesday morning, Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) told reporters, “I don’t think there’s any support to bring it up.”“A lot of people say they don’t want to roll back their Second Amendment rights,” said Deborah Johnson, one of the organizers of the gun control rally on Wednesday night. “Well, we don’t know how to control our Second Amendment rights. We abuse our Second Amendment rights. How many mass shootings have to happen before we have an honest conversation?”",1

Jonathan Mossberg wanted to be the Steve Jobs of firearms.In 1999, a few years before the invention of the iPod, Mossberg began to build the iGun, a computer-chip-equipped “smart gun” that could only be fired by its owner. (The “i” stands for intelligence.) He saw the technology as a commonsense way to prevent gun violence—a no-brainer safety device like seatbelts or air bags. The iGun is a shotgun equipped with a radio frequency identification (RFID) sensor that only allows it to be fired by someone wearing a special ring. By 2000, a fully functional version had endured a grueling round of military-grade testing and was ready to hit the market. “When I filed my patents, my patent attorney said, ‘You’ve got the next dot-com,'” Mossberg recalls. “He was blown away.”Mossberg wasn’t the first person to envision a smart gun, but he was well positioned to make it a reality. He was a scion of O.F. Mossberg & Sons, the nation’s oldest family-owned gun company, which makes one of the world’s best-selling lines of pump-action shotguns. He’d overseen manufacturing for the company and had also served as president of Uzi America, an importer of Israeli weapons.But the iGun hit a wall. Consumers were skeptical, in part because gun rights groups had been painting smart guns as a Trojan horse for gun grabbers. A few years earlier, gun manufacturer Colt had unveiled a smart-watch-activated pistol, and Smith & Wesson had pledged to explore “authorized user technology” for its weapons. Both projects were abandoned in the face of withering criticism from the National Rifle Association, which led a boycott of Smith & Wesson. In 2005, under pressure from the NRA, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, making gun manufacturers immune from lawsuits related to gun accidents or misuse—and removing another incentive to develop smart guns. (Today, the NRA says it doesn’t oppose smart guns but claims they are an attempt to make firearms more expensive and “would allow guns to be disabled remotely.”)Ever since, no major firearms maker has touched the smart-gun concept—including O.F. Mossberg & Sons. “They are doing so well that they have little to gain,” Mossberg says of his family’s company (which he left in 2000). Though they see the benefits of smart guns, “should this turn into a Smith & Wesson boycott-type thing, they don’t want to be associated with that. And I don’t blame them.”After shelving the iGun for more than a decade, Mossberg has reloaded. Americans’ trust in consumer electronics has grown, along with their concern about gun violence and safety. “The whole thing has gained a lot of momentum again,” says Mossberg, who today owns the exclusive rights to produce and market the iGun. He says he receives emails nearly every day asking about its price and availability.Silicon chips have shrunk to the point that Mossberg can produce a 9 mm handgun version of the iGun, tapping a much larger market. While O.F. Mossberg & Sons’ research once suggested that gun owners were skeptical of weapons containing circuit boards, a 2013 survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun manufacturers’ trade association, found that 14 percent of all gun owners were somewhat or very likely to buy smart guns. Though the NSSF spun those results as bad for smart guns, Mossberg sees an opportunity potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “I know lots of people who would love to get 14 percent of the firearms market,” he says. And new research shows the market could be much bigger. A nationally representative survey published by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in December found that nearly 60 percent of Americans, if they were to buy a new handgun, would be willing to purchase a smart gun.Police departments have also come around to the concept of issuing firearms that can’t be used by bad guys. More than 5 percent of officers killed in the line of duty are shot with their own weapons, often 9 mm handguns. In November, San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr told 60 Minutes that he wanted his officers to have the option to carry smart guns if they were available. More than a dozen law enforcement agencies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Florida have tested the iGun in recent months, according to Mossberg.Smart guns have also gained a powerful ally in Washington. In January, President Obama directed the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a strategy to promote smart gun research and expedite government procurement of the weapons.To bring a smart pistol to market, Mossberg says he needs to raise about $1 million for research and development—money that almost certainly won’t come from O.F. Mossberg & Sons or any other major firearms company. Following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway announced an effort to fund start-up companies dedicated to promoting gun safety. Conway’s Smart Tech Challenges Foundation gave Mossberg a grant of $100,000, which helped generate buzz for smart guns in the Valley. Yet nearly two years later, not a single venture capital firm has backed a smart-gun company. Margot Hirsch, the president of Smart Tech Challenges, says tech investors didn’t have smart guns on their radar in the past, but she hopes that now “the VC community and impact investors will be interested in investing, not only to make money, but to save lives.”Mossberg sees no reason why his product should be controversial. “In the 1700s and 1800s, there was still no manual safety device on a gun,” he observes, referring to the safety catches that are now ubiquitous on American handguns and rifles. “And then somebody put one on there and nobody cared. This is nothing more than that.”window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={""beacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""licenseKey"":""949ceaf672"",""applicationID"":""42428067"",""transactionName"":""MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMTD1VE"",""queueTime"":0,""applicationTime"":124,""atts"":""HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse"",""errorBeacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""agent"":""""}",1

In Orlando this afternoon, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with victims’ families and survivors of the massacre at the Pulse LGBT nightclub that claimed the lives of 49 people just days ago.Obama spoke about an increasingly urgent need for gun control legislation, saying “we need to work across political lines to do more to stop killers who want to terrorize us.”“The last two terrorist attacks on our soil—Orlando and San Bernardino—were homegrown,” he said. “Our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual…to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons…legally.”He insisted that the debate surrounding gun control needs to change, and called on the House and Senate to “rise to the moment and do the right thing” and pass legislation to curb access to weapons like the AR-15. “For so many [LGBT] people, the Pulse has been a safe haven…and on Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way possible,” Obama said. “Americans were targeted because we’re a country that’s learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.”Watch his remarks in full below:WATCH: President Obama’s full remarks after meeting with #Orlando shooting survivors and families of victims. https://t.co/qkyc0gPb3N	— ABC News (@ABC) June 16, 2016 ",1
36,"Yin Bogu/ZumaIt didn’t take long after the massacre in Orlando for the conversation to turn to gun control, especially considering the shooter allegedly used a weapon of war that he purchased legally just days before his attack on the gay nightclub.Is the worst mass shooting in history enough to finally move the needle on the gun control conversation? Time will tell. But an interesting perspective on the question comes via the team over at Google Trends, who have been crunching the search giant’s internal numbers on searches related to guns. Take a look how searches—represented on the maps below as ranked search terms within Google—have evolved over the last year, and even in the wake of the Orlando massacre.Here’s the 2015 average for the search terms “Gun control” and “Gun shop,” with each state colored by whichever term had a higher average search rank:You can see that “Gun shop” was the higher search term in most states in 2015, but that was starting to change in 2016. Take a look: But that’s changed in a big way since Orlando, where searches for “Gun control” dominate in every state except Kentucky:The “gun control” search term might have had a bounce post-Orlando since it’s a natural topic of conversation and one of the major news topics over the last few days and it is unclear whether a massacre of 49 mostly LGBTQ innocent people has inspired the population to take gun control more seriously. But maybe something is changing. Google Trends also looked at the same type of search traffic in the wake of other mass shootings, including after Oregon, Virginia, and Charleston. In those cases, search traffic for “Gun control” spiked only after Oregon: ",1

The Las Vegas native specifically called out President Trump and Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan for failing to act “because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.”“The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a number of other lawmakers who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip, also sent their thoughts and their prayers today—which is good,” Kimmel said.“They should be praying,” he continued. “They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country because it is so crazy.”Kimmel also showed the images of senators who just days after the Orlando shooting in June 2016 voted against a bill that would have closed certain gun sale loopholes. “These are the 56 senators who didn’t want to do anything about that,” he said.The powerful plea comes on the heels of similar emotional speeches from Kimmel over Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",1

Phillip/APThe evening after a gunman killed 10 people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Houston police chief Art Acevedo took to Facebook to write an impassioned plea for gun control, writing that he had hit “rock bottom” after the massacre.“I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children,” Acevedo wrote in his post. “I know some have strong feelings about gun rights…I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue.”The Santa Fe High School shooting, 35 miles outside of Houston, is far from the first mass shooting to affect Texas cities in the past few years. Six months ago, 26 people were killed at the Texas First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. And in 2016, a gunman killed 5 police officers in Dallas. At least 99 people have died in 8 mass shootings in the state since 1984.Acevedo has called for stronger gun measures before, and on March 24 he joined in Houston’s March for Our Lives, one of many marches across the country spearheaded by teen survivors of the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.Here is his full Facebook post:To all my Facebook friends. Today I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children and a responding police officer who is clinging to life. I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve shed tears of sadness, pain and anger.I know some have strong feelings about gun rights but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue. Please do not post anything about guns aren’t the problem and there’s little we can do. My feelings won’t be hurt if you de-friend me and I hope yours won’t be if you decide to post about your views and I de-friend you.I have never accepted the status-quo in anything I do and I’ve never accepted defeat. And I won’t do it now. I will continue to speak up and will stand up for what my heart and my God commands me to do, and I assure you he hasn’t instructed me to believe that gun-rights are bestowed by him.The hatred being spewed in our country and the new norms we, so-called people of faith are accepting, is as much to blame for so much of the violence in our once pragmatic Nation.This isn’t a time for prayers, and study and Inaction, it’s a time for prayers, action and the asking of God’s forgiveness for our inaction (especially the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing).I close by saying, I wish those that move on from this page the best.

Even as the National Rifle Association celebrates Donald Trump’s victory, gun control advocates have something to smile about today. Of the four gun-related measures on state ballots this year, three passed.The only gun-related ballot measure not to win, Question 3 asked voters whether background checks should be required for private gun sales. If neither the buyer nor the seller is a licensed gun dealer, they’d have to go to a licensed dealer who would run a background check. The measure would have also required a background check for loaning guns, with exceptions for gun transfers between family members, emergency self-defense, and temporary transfers for hunting and sport shooting. Supporters, including Maine Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense Fund and Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership Fund, have spent $5.2 million to get the measure passed. Approximately $1 million was spent against it, the vast majority by the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action.Prop 63 passed easily, garnering 63 percent of the vote. It will ban certain types of semi-automatic assault rifles, require background checks for ammunition sales, outlaw magazines that carry more than 10 bullets, create a system for confiscating guns from felons, and require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. Major components of the initiative already became law earlier this year, and gun rights groups say they will challenge the overlapping laws in court. Opponents spent nearly $1 million against the measure to the nearly $4.5 million spent by supporters.Similar to Maine’s ballot initiative, Question 1 will require most gun sales, including private sales, to be subject to a background check. However, it narrowly passed by less than 10,000 votes. The same exemptions that Maine allows also apply here. Supporters spent more than $18 million and received significant financial backing from Everytown For Gun Safety. The NRA Nevadans for Gun Freedom and Nevadans for State Gun Rights spent nearly $6.5 million to sink the initiative. The NRA stuck to its usual script in opposing the measure, writing, “Question 1 does nothing to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms.”Initiative 1491 allows family, household members, and police to petition a judge to temporarily prohibit a person’s access to guns if that person is found to be a risk to himself or others. Petitions for an “extreme risk protection order” will last one year. Those under order can request a hearing to argue against the order. The NRA opposed the measure, saying that “if a person is truly dangerous, existing law already provides a variety of mechanisms to deal with the individual.” Nonetheless, it passed with 71 percent of the vote.",1

On Monday, the Senate failed to move forward two gun control measures aimed at expanding background checks and blocking individuals listed on terrorist watch lists from obtaining weapons. This outcome was widely expected, even after a 15-hour marathon filibuster staged by Senate Democrats urging their fellow lawmakers to act on gun control in the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history.As Samantha Bee noted on the latest Full Frontal on Monday, Republicans including “rodent-faced soup sponge” Sen. Ted Cruz, have dismissed calls for increased gun control since the Orlando mass shooting as nothing more than a political game and political correctness staged by Democrats. Much of this, as Bee explained, is the result of the strong grip the National Rifle Association has on Republican lawmakers. Watch above as she slams the GOP, or as Bee calls the party “puppets of the NRA,” in the segment above.",1
41,"ABC NewsFive students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, made their way through all the major morning talks shows Sunday, appearing on NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and CNN. They announced nationwide marches for gun control next month and ripped politicians, including President Donald Trump, who benefit from the National Rifle Association’s political spending while refusing to act to strengthen gun laws.“Now is the time to get on the right side of this,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the students, said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “Because this is not something we are going to be let [you] sweep under the carpet.” Gonzalez said she was speaking directly to Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), and other lawmakers who have benefited from pro-gun money.“These people who are being funded by the NRA are not going to be allowed to remain in office when midterm elections roll around,” she said. “They are going to be voted out of office.”Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Alex Wind, and Jaclyn Corin are among the survivors of the shooting that killed 17 people at the high school on Wednesday. They drew praise from network and cable news hosts as they offered pointed advice for lawmakers and older Americans.On Sunday afternoon, the White House announced that Trump will hold what it called a listening session on gun violence with high school students this coming Wednesday. The White House did not say which students Trump would meet with or if he would speak with the students organizing the marches. Some Stoneman Douglas students and parents have said they don’t want to meet with Trump, the Daily Beast reported Friday.“We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” Kasky said on CNN’s State of the Union.“This is about us begging for our lives,” Kasky said. “This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about us creating a badge of shame for any politicians accepting money from the NRA and using us as collateral.”The students said they are planning are series of demonstrations called “March for Our Lives” that will take place around the country on March 24. It will include a rally in Washington. Other students are planning a nationwide school walkout on April  20—the 19th anniversary of the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado—to highlight lawmakers’ failure to address the problem.“We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks,” Gonzalez said during a speech at a rally on Saturday. “Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because…we are going to be the last mass shooting.”Other students from the school on Sunday criticized Trump for a tweet in which he blamed the the ongoing Russia probe for the FBI’s failure to act on warnings about the alleged gunman. Trump’s tweet drew widespread condemnation.",1
42,"Semi-automatic rifles line the walls of a gun shop in Lynnwood, Washington.Elaine Thompson/APThe day after a new poll revealed that 95 percent of American voters support universal background checks for gun purchases—a record high—a bi-partisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to improve the federal background check system.The measure would not mandate a background check for every gun sale. The “compromise” legislation, as the senators put it, would instead focus on requiring state and federal agencies to do a better job of entering criminal history records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), as is already required by law. The Fix NICS Act would penalize federal agencies that fail to properly input records and incentivize states to improve their overall reporting.The group of seven senators sponsoring the bill is led by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who has an A+ rating from the NRA, and includes four Republicans and three Democrats—Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), all prominent gun safety advocates.“It’s no secret that I believe much more needs to be done,” Sen. Murphy said in a statement on Thursday. “But this bill will make sure that thousands of dangerous people are prevented from buying guns. It represents the strongest update to the background checks system in a decade, and provides the foundation for more compromise in the future.”The bill was inspired by an apparent loophole that came to light in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at a baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 dead earlier this month. The shooter had a history of domestic abuse; as a member of the Air Force, he’d been court-martialed for two charges of domestic assault, sentenced to 12 months of confinement, and was kicked out of the military in 2014 with a Bad Conduct Discharge. Technically, his crimes prevented him from legally buying a gun, but the Air Force never submitted the criminal records for the the NICS database, allowing him to pass a background check and purchase a gun. It’s unclear how frequently this occurs, but the Trace found that it may be a much wider problem than this isolated incident.“Mass murderers in Sutherland Springs, Charleston, and Blacksburg were legally prohibited from accessing firearms, but gaps in NICS allowed each of them to walk out of a gun store with the weapons used to commit their crimes,” said Sen. Blumenthal. He told the New York Times, “It may seem to many like a baby step, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and this one could well be important in breaking the ice of complicity that has paralyzed Congress.”This isn’t the first time that lawmakers have introduced a law to force federal agencies to better comply with existing gun-control laws. In 2007, the House voted to close a loophole that allowed the Virginia Tech gunman to purchase weapons despite having been committed to a mental hospital. It provided grant money for states to update the background checks database, adding more criminal records and mental health information, and was similarly viewed as a compromise bill between lawmakers with opposing political views. A co-sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), said at the time, “This act will ensure that the background check system really is instant and accurate.” There has been improvement in reporting on both criminal backgrounds and mental health since then, but ten years and several mass shootings later shows there is still much to be done.",1
43,"Gerrymandering activists gather outside the Supreme Court in March. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via APThe Supreme Court dealt a big blow Monday to efforts to combat racial gerrymandering, approving Texas’ GOP-drawn political maps that had previously been found to discriminate intentionally against minority voters. In a 5-4 ruling, the court upheld the state’s congressional and legislative maps, with the exception of the map of one state legislative district, which the court struck down for reducing the voting power of minority groups. The court’s decision overturns the findings of the federal district court in Texas, which had found not only that the Legislature had discriminated against minorities in drawing certain districts, but also that the discrimination was an intentional effort to “ensure Anglo control.” But the court’s conservative majority disagreed, reversing the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination.Justice Sonia Sotomoyor issued a blistering dissent, joined by the other liberal justices. This decision “comes at serious costs to our democracy,” she wrote. “It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas—despite constituting a majority of the population within the State—will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.” The Texas case presented a quandary for the Supreme Court. In 2013, the court gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act, eliminating the ability of the federal government to block state and local election laws that discriminated against minorities. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the country had changed, and that the racism that had pervaded election practices since the civil rights movement had dissipated. Texas challenged that narrative. The state has lost nine racial discrimination voting cases since 2011, with multiple judges finding that the discrimination was intentional—including in the political maps at issue in this case.The court’s decision Monday is in keeping with its 2013 ruling. Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the majority “blinds itself to the overwhelming factual record…to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.”This latest battle over Texas’ political maps began shortly after the last redistricting period following the 2010 census. Texas’ population had ballooned over the previous decade due to the state’s rapidly expanding minority population, and nearly 90 percent of Texas’ 4.3 million new residents were Latino or African American. As the fastest-growing state, Texas received four new congressional districts. But when the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political maps the following year, it created four new districts that were largely controlled by white voters. Latino and African American rights groups sued over the new maps.A federal court blocked the 2011 maps and hastily put in place a tweaked version ahead of the 2012 elections for Congress and the state Legislature. These maps were intended to be temporary. But as soon as the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Texas Republicans simply passed these temporary maps as the state’s new permanent maps. Minority rights groups, including the Texas branch of the NAACP and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, challenged these maps, arguing that they retained the bias of the blocked 2011 maps they were based on. Last year, a district court in San Antonio agreed, finding in two separate rulings that the 2011 and 2013 maps intentionally discriminated by weakening the voting power of black and Latino voters.Conservative justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for the majority in Monday’s ruling. In upholding Texas’ maps, he found fault in the district court’s analysis. “Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State,” he wrote. “In redistricting cases, the ‘good faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.'”  The court’s ruling will allow the Republican-drawn maps to remain in place through the 2020 elections, until the next round of redistricting takes place following the census that year. But even then, it could shape the next decade’s maps: The court’s ruling will likely be seen as an open invitation for Republicans to continue to weaken the voting power of minority, Democratic-leaning voters in Texas and across the country. ",1

The latest involved White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday, when the owner of a Lexington, Virginia, restaurant asked her to leave over the Trump administration’s “inhumane” policies.Adding to the misrepresentations Monday, Trump also appeared to accuse House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of supporting Waters’ remarks moments after Pelosi did exactly the opposite.In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again.

In the days immediately following the election, Kierstead held a narrow lead over Rouda, a real estate investor. As OC workers slowly worked their way through the ballots, Rouda gained on, and eventually surpassed, Kierstead. As of Sunday, Rouda held a 126 vote lead over Kierstead.  I just got off the phone with @drhanskeirstead.

Demographically, the district has a slight white majority, but about 40 percent of the its residents are either Latino or Asian. Its median annual household income is a healthy $89,000.Heading into the June 5 primary, many worried that California’s uncommon top-two “jungle primary”—where the top-two primary vote-getters, regardless of party, duke it out in the November general election—could conceivably have lead to Democrats getting locked out of the November general election.That didn’t happen. On June 6, Democrats let out a sigh of relief as it became clear they had avoided a lock-out in all the in-play districts. But in California’s 48th, the question of which Democrat would advance wasn’t clear until 19 days after the election.Though Rouda will likely tap broad Democratic financial support on his path to the November general election, his primary victory is basically the result a coin flip. The California State Democratic Party voted in February to endorse Keirstead, but the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) opted to spend money boosting Rouda in the days before the primary election.Incidentally, the DCCC also spent more than $100,000 boosting a lower polling Republican candidate John Gabbard, presumably to siphon votes away from another, stronger candidate Scott Baugh, to decrease the likelihood of Democrats getting shut out of the November general election, according to Open Secrets.In the primary, both Rouda and Keirstead ran on progressive platforms. If elected, Rouda has pledged to advocate for Medicare for all.",1
46,"February 21, 2018 - Washington, District of Columbia - Students from the DC area walk out of class to demand gun control legislation at a gathering outside the White House. Erin Scott/ZUMA WireFollowing the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month, all eyes are on the students who have garnered an unprecedented amount of national attention from their calls for gun control. In the couple of weeks since the shooting, the students have grilled politicians on live television, mocked conspiracy theorists on Twitter, and inspired hundreds of people across the country to demand action from their state legislators and from Washington.Three major national protests are already in the works and will take place over the next few months, adding to a regular stream of local activism. Here’s a look at what to expect:March 14: “Enough” national school walk outWith leadership from the Women’s March organizers, students and teachers across the country are planning “Enough“—a national school walkout scheduled for March 14.According to the event’s Facebook page, the walk out will begin at 10 a.m. in each time zone and last for 17 minutes, one minute for every victim who died in the Parkland shooting; 33,000 people have RSVP-ed on Facebook that they will attend. Dozens of schools are listed on the Enough homepage as participating.“We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns. Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that address the public health crisis of gun violence,” the organizers write on the march’s homepage. “We want Congress to pay attention and take note: many of us will vote this November and many others will join in 2020.”March 24: March For Our LivesTen days later, on March 24, the “March For Our Lives” will descend on Washington, D.C. The organizing for this rally began with survivors of the Parkland shooting but now involves students nationwide. Their goal is to demand that a “comprehensive and effective bill be immediately” introduced in Congress to address gun violence. “March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,” the organizers write on their website. “In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut short in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March For Our Lives believes the time is now.” This march gained additional notoriety last week when celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and George Clooney each promised to donate $500,000 to the march. According to the Washington Post, organizers expect nearly 500,000 attendees in Washington. There will also be dozens of sister marches across the country. April 20: National High School WalkoutOn the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, another national walk out will take place—this one organized by Lane Murdock, a 15 year-old high school student in Connecticut, to protest gun violence in schools and inaction by lawmakers.Murdock created a petition on Change.org to publicize the walk-out: “Public school shootings affect communities and especially teenagers,” she wrote. “On February, 14th a High School shooting in Parkland, Florida occurred, killing 17 people. Still, POTUS has not addressed any form of gun legislation. The majority of teenagers have no right to vote, leaving our voice unheard.” Around 200,000 people have signed the petition online, committing to walk out of their schools on April 20, and teachers across the country are planning to join. According to the Hartford Courant, students will also stand in silence for 17 minutes for each victim of the tragedy. Are there other protests being planned, perhaps in your local area?

With teenagers demonstrating outside the Capitol, both the House and Senate on Wednesday made vague efforts to deal with school safety issues, holding votes and hearings that attempted to address the matter without actually tightening gun laws.Fix this before I text my mom from under a desk #NationalSchoolWalkout pic.twitter.com/bk820wL7Kt— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018In the House, members voted to pass the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that reauthorizes a 2001 Justice Department program designed to prevent school violence. It provides $50 million in federal funding to help schools train staff in identifying mental health issues and violent behavior; establish an anonymous reporting system; and pay for school security measures, such as metal detectors and locks. The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, includes no gun-related provisions. And while it received overwhelming bipartisan support―only 10 members opposed it―Democrats have sharply criticized GOP lawmakers for not doing more to curtail access to guns.The bill represents the first major vote on school safety since the February shooting in Parkland, but it was not originally a reaction to the massacre. A bipartisan group of lawmakers―including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), who represents Parkland―introduced the bill at the end of January, and it had received support from anti-school-violence groups at that time. Deutch told Politico that “it is in no way a response to Stoneman Douglas and does not address the gun violence epidemic in our country.” Following the shooting, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced companion legislation in the Senate, where it was met with similarly broad, bipartisan support.Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2018In the Senate, the Judiciary committee held a hearing Wednesday to investigate the failures of federal authorities to effectively respond to warning signs displayed by the Florida gunman. Senators took the opportunity to grill FBI Acting Deputy Director David Bowdich on the White House’s gun and school safety proposals and to ask about other potential reform measures. Bowdich―who’s held the job since the end of January, following the resignation of Andrew McCabe―seemed to leave at least some lawmakers unsatisfied.For example, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) brought up Trump’s proposal for arming teachers and pointed to research showing that harsh school discipline often disproportionately affects students of color. When Harris asked Bowdich if the White House plan would include implicit bias training designed to prevent teachers from shooting innocent students, Bowdich said, “I never really put the two together.”Officials from the Secret Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives received a similar reception from lawmakers when they failed to answer questions about the efficacy of student risk assessments and background checks for gun sales. And incredibly, none of the three executive branch representatives were familiar with the Dickey Amendment, federal legislation that prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding public health research into gun violence.Members of the Parkland community also weighed in at the hearing, including Stoneman Douglas teacher Katherine Posada and Ryan Petty, the father of a student killed in the shooting. Petty urged Congress to follow the example of lawmakers in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott (R) just signed a package of bipartisan gun restrictions over the objections of the National Rifle Association. The Florida legislation established a three-day waiting period for gun sales, raised the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21, and provided $400 million for mental health services and school safety resources, such as bulletproof glass and metal detectors. Petty said he hopes to spend Thursday meeting with Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss how the parties could find common ground on the issue.The march is on the way to the Capitol building #nationalschoolwalkout pic.twitter.com/KdeOuCnVcY— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018Despite the calls from students and activists across the country, no gun control measures have gained any traction in Congress in the month since the Parkland shooting—repeating a pattern that has persisted since the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. As that stalemate continues, Congress’ school safety conversations will proceed. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) says the House plans to hold its own oversight hearing on the FBI’s failures to investigate the Florida gunman prior to the shooting. And next week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is expected to appear before two House committees to discuss the White House’s plans to address gun violence.",1
49,"Royce Christensen, Las Vegas massacre survivor, attends his first gun safety rally.Mother Jones/Al Kamalizad“Damn!” says Royce Christensen, 22, beaming at his mother, Darla, as they troop through Saturday’s March for Our Lives demonstration in Salt Lake City, Utah. They make their way along the route from West High School to the steps of the state Capitol building, and the crowd chants, “Vote them out!” It’s a huge turnout. “And this is a red state!” Christensen exclaims.“Imagine what D.C. is like,” replies Darla.“Yeah,” Christensen nods. “D.C.”Royce wore a T-shirt to the march that identifies who he is: “Survivor,” it reads. “#VegasStrong.” Nearly six months ago, Royce and several members of his family were working as security guards at the Route 91 musical festival in Las Vegas when a barrage of bullets rained down in what would come to be known as the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Royce felt the bullets zipping overhead, kicking up shards of aluminum as they hit the stage. He saw people drop.And so on the cusp of the half-year anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre, we traveled with Christensen and his family as they drove north from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah, where they met up with Christensen’s fiancé to attend the March for Our Lives rally. It’s the first political rally that Christensen has ever marched in. On the drive up, he had said he wanted to “make something happen” after the Vegas shooting, and when he saw “the opportunity join something that seems to actually be gaining traction, that seems to be gripping onto the steps of the government for once,” he had to be part of it.He began the morning “ready for this,” but also nervous. He’d heard that there would be a counter-protest and that some of those demonstrators would be carrying weapons. He was also nervous that his ideas about gun control wouldn’t entirely align with those expressed at the rally. He’s had fun target shooting in the past. He doesn’t want the Second Amendment abolished. On the one hand, “Guns are awesome,” he says. On the other: “They need to be controlled.”Mother Jones first met Christensen two days after the Las Vegas massacre last October at a candlelit vigil, where he told the story of how he had tried to keep people calm and hidden as the gunfire blared on. When it was finally over, thousands of bullets and 10 long minutes later, he saw a truck, its bed filled with the wounded, speeding toward a hospital. The concert ground was “a maze of bodies.”“As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now.”Christensen wasn’t hit with a bullet during the Las Vegas massacre, but he’s been suffering ever since. He has a hard time sleeping, and when he does, his sleep is filled with nightmares. Tall buildings and balconies that someone could fire from make him nervous. When a car backfires or someone lights fireworks—not uncommon occurrences in Las Vegas, where he lives—he reacts, diving behind his bed or running through the house, switching off lights and pulling down blinds. He takes medicine for post-traumatic stress and sees a therapist at least once a week. Christensen has the rare gift of photographic memory, but nowadays, it feels like a curse. “As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now,” he says.At the rally, there’s a booming crowd of “people who care about what has happened,” he says. “I thought maybe 30, 50 people [would show up]. I think this is at least 400 people already. I did not think this many would show up at all.”He’s looked at the signs people carry and has listened to their goals for gun safety, and their fight for gun control doesn’t feel too extreme for him.”These people want common sense changes,” he says. “They don’t want to get rid of the Second Amendment.”If the counter-protestors are here with their guns, he doesn’t see them.As protesters chant, “Enough is enough!” and “Never Again!” he chants with them. When he meets other attendees, he introduces himself as a “proud survivor of the worst mass shooting in modern American history” and tells them that he’s marching with the hope that there will never be a new “worst mass shooting” again.Once the march reaches the Capitol building, Royce sits with his fiancé and his mother on the steps, facing a crowd that has grown to 8,000 people. While they listen to speeches from the student organizers, he and Darla lock eyes, and Darla weeps.After the last speech ends and the plaza clears, Christensen remains on the steps, awestruck. “I have not seen this kind of motivation before,” he says. “This is something new; I can feel it in the air.”Prior to the trip to Salt Lake City, Christensen sent a note to Mother Jones, full with anger, but also hope: “Pardon my French but when the worst shooting in United States history happened absolutely fucking nothing was done. When the church shooting that soon followed again absolutely nothing happened government-wise. Now after the Florida school shooting a large outcry is finally loud enough and has the staying power. I want to make sure that everyone remembers all the lives lost. I think this time these kids might change the world.”Now, after the rally, he’s even more hopeful and motivated. “This is change coming.”",1
50,"During a televised meeting with Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House, President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to broadly support a wide range of initiatives aimed at preventing future mass shootings. They ranged from endorsing stronger background checks to implementing “offensive” capabilities inside schools.One of the most striking moments came when it became increasingly clear that Trump was unfamiliar with the contents of the Manchin-Toomey bill, which famously failed to pass the Senate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. The 2013 legislation, which focused on expanding background checks and was strongly supported by then-President Barack Obama, marks the closest Congress has come in recent years to passing meaningful gun-control legislation. The speech Obama gave in response to the bill’s failure is regarded as his angriest public display. But on Wednesday, Trump appeared to blame his predecessor for the bill’s failure. It was just one of several times the president seemed to suggest that Obama didn’t push hard enough on gun control while in office. Trump also accused Toomey, who was in the room for Wednesday’s meeting, of being “afraid of the NRA” for not including language to raise the minimum age to purchase certain weapons.Sen. Pat Toomey tells President Trump that the Manchin-Toomey bill doesn’t deal with raising age limits from 18 to 21 to buy certain weapons.Trump: “You know why, because you are afraid of the NRA” https://t.co/vGNDzAlLt0— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 28, 2018At another point, Trump said he supported illegally seizing firearms from potential killers first, and then dealing with the due process. “I like taking the guns early,” he said in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s suggestion to do the exact opposite.WATCH: President Trump: ""I like taking the guns early … Take the guns first, go through due process second."" pic.twitter.com/aydEZdAGq0— NBC News (@NBCNews) February 28, 2018Trump later raised eyebrows when he suggested that a ban on assault weapons should also be included in the Manchin-Toomey bill. The surprising proposal was reminiscent of the January meeting at which lawmakers from both parties came together with the president to talk about immigration, and Trump agreed with Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s push for a clean bill on DACA. (Trump, of course, quickly backtracked, and later sought to kill a bipartisan bill many observers considered Congress’ best shot at a DACA resolution.)Nevertheless, Feinstein, who was sitting next to Trump at Wednesday’s meeting, looked quite pleased with Trump’s recommendation on assault weapons.Feinstein's reaction when Trump says she should add assault weapons ban to Manchin-Toomey pic.twitter.com/7dlKxwa1KO— Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) February 28, 2018",1
51,"Hundreds of students and community activists marched in protest of the inaction of lawmakers on the issue of gun violence, on February 23, 2018 in Tampa, Fla.Monica Herndon/ZUMABack in 2011, after a gunman in Tucson killed six people and wounded 13, including US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Americans took a fatalistic view of whether anything could be done to stop future mass shootings. A CNN poll at the time showed that voters believed by a 2-1 margin that there was nothing the government could do to prevent future attacks. Seven years later, that’s all changed. A new poll released by CNN on Sunday found that 64 percent of American voters now believe the government can “take action that will be effective” in preventing mass shootings in the future. Only 32 percent believe that such attacks will happen “regardless” of government action. The poll comes a week and a half after the Feb 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida left 17 dead.Here’s how the new numbers compare to poll results after previous mass shootings:if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""]={},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas={""100"":437,""200"":312,""300"":262,""400"":262,""500"":237,""700"":237,""800"":212,""900"":212,""1000"":212},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-xnxBM""),window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""xnxBM""==b)window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});What’s more, Americans are remarkably clear on exactly which steps they want the government to take. According to a separate poll released Sunday, conducted by USA Today/Suffolk University:Of course, just because people believe that government action would be effective, doesn’t mean they have confidence the government will act. Only about 1 in 5 respondents in the USA Today poll believe that Congress will take action on gun control: 28 percent of Republicans, and 14 percent of Democrats.Since the shooting, teen survivors of the tragedy continue to drum up national attention on the issue; the most famous of the bunch, Emma González, now has more Twitter followers than the National Rifle Association. But as Republican members of Congress return after a 10-day break, the Associated Press reports, they don’t appear to have much in the works. Even the most likely path forward—a modest bill to improve the accuracy of the federal background check system—has stalled, because it’s tied to a pro-gun plan to allow gun permits in one state to be recognized in all other states.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is earning some of his worst job approval marks of his presidency. Just 38 percent of voters currently approve of Trump’s job performance, the USA Today poll found—the lowest the president has ever scored, by their measure. According to Sunday’s CNN poll, Trump’s approval rating is down to 35 percent.",1
52,"Stop Mass Incarcerations Network sponsored a children's march demanding accountability on the one year anniversary of Tamir Rice's death at the hands of the Cleveland police. Andy Katz/APAfter the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last week, it quickly became clear that it wouldn’t be politicians or veteran activists leading the effort to demand action against gun violence—it would be students. Calls for action from the Stoneman Douglas students and their peers across the country have received an outpouring of support in the form of national attention and celebrity donations: Just this week, George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey each pledged to donate $500,000 to the March for Our Lives, a group “created and led” by kids to organize a national protest against gun violence on March 24 in Washington, D.C. George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’  These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.— Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) February 20, 2018Wednesday night, several Stoneman Douglas students stunned the nation by grilling elected officials and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch at a town hall. The following morning, Obama praised the young folks in a tweet: “How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We’ve been waiting for you.” But as Roxane Gay, a celebrated American writer, pointed out on Twitter, this is not the first time kids have been doing the hard work of political organizing and protest in the wake of trauma.  It is interesting to note the difference in support for the kids in FL versus the kids in Black Lives Matter. I say that with full admiration for the kids in FL, to survive such a trauma and fight for everyone to be safer. But that’s also what was happening in Ferguson and beyond— roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2018Gay is, of course, correct. Throughout history, kids from all backgrounds have been crucial in the fight for social justice. Child Labor ProtestsIn 1903, prominent labor organizer Mary Harris “Mother” Jones (who is also the namesake of this magazine) marched from Philadelphia to New York City with 400 “juvenile workers” to protest child labor in textile mills. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the “‘children’s army’…made frequent stops to give speeches and to show the public the effects of exploitation, as many of the children marching were permanently maimed, which provided real proof of the dangers of their employment.” Mother Jones and her “army” of textile workers on their march from Philadelphia to New York City to protest child labor.Library of Congress, Pierce & JonesA few years later, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York “passed the nation’s first true child labor laws,” the Inquirer reports. Teenagers and children played a major role throughout the civil rights movement. In 1955, before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., another young woman by the name of Claudette Colvin did the same thing—except she was 15 years old. After she was arrested and sent to jail, Colvin became one of the four plaintiffs in the Browder v. Gayle Supreme Court case, which ultimately desegregated buses in Alabama.In 1957, the governor of Arkansas dispatched the state national guard to prevent the students who went down in history as the Little Rock Nine from attending a newly integrated high school. President Eisenhower sent 1,200 soldiers to protect them later that month. In spite of daily threats and violence, the students attended the school for the full year.Less than a decade after that, thousands of children and teenagers protested segregation by marching across Birmingham, Ala., on May 2, 1963. Hundreds of black children were arrested and crowded into the local jails. The next day, on orders from a city official, police sprayed the children who continued to march with water hoses and hit them with batons. They kept going anyway.Over 1000 children and teens were arrested in protests on May 2, 1963 in Birmingham. The city ran out of jail space. pic.twitter.com/0GgWsfYseQ— Maria Chong (@mariachong) February 21, 2018“We didn’t hate white people,” Janice Wesley Kelsey, who was arrested at the protests when she was in 11th grade, recalled to The New Yorker. “We didn’t even know any. We hated the system. That’s what we were protesting about.”Eight days later, civil rights leaders announced that they had come to an agreement with city officials: Birmingham would desegregate businesses and release the detained protesters.Two months after that, President Kennedy took to national television to denounce segregation and propose new civil rights legislation.As Gay noted, children and teenagers have also been heavily involved in the Black Lives Matter movement since its inception. In 2014, for example, after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, black kids were heavily present in the protests that became a major turning point for the movement. Children watch from their home as people march to protest the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Many residents of the St. Louis suburb have said they feel like they are living in a war zone following the shooting of Michael Brown by police. Charlie Riedel / Associated PressParents across the country recognized the historical importance of the moment and wanted their children to bear witness.“It was important for them to be there,” Kendra Pierson, who brought her sons to an Atlanta vigil to honor Brown, told Huffington Post. “When they look back, in 10 years or five years, I want them to know they were there.” Pierson’s children were six and two years old at the time.Protester Janelle Pittman holds her 6-year-old daughter, Kat, as police in riot gear stand guard in Ferguson, Mo. on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014.Jeff Roberson / Associated Press.Their activism has continued on through the present.As demonstrators begin to gather, children and adults hold signs during a rally Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2014, in Charlotte, N.C. to protest the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer for the death of Michael Brown. John D.

This is amazing. And a I’m not being sarcastic. I have to be honest and say that I’m a bit taken aback (and a bit hurt) that those of us who were in the streets in the past five years for Black lives didn’t receive this type of reception or public support. https://t.co/HLYXTcVdfL— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018I promise y’all. I’m happy for these young people. I just know how so many young people have put their lives on the line over the past five years.

I shouldn’t be bothered, but I am.— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018NFL Anthem ProtestsIn 2016, NFL player Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem before football games to protest police brutality and the systemic oppression of people of color in the United States. Soon enough, high school and college students across the country were following his lead. Before tonight’s Oakland A’s game, the OUSD Honor Band played the national anthem. And because of the heated national debate over racial justice, the students decided to take a knee for the whole song. They said they were protesting racism, police brutality and President Trump for saying what he did about protesting @nfl players who take a knee. See the video on the OUSD Facebook page. #iamOUSDA post shared by  Oakland School District (@ousdnews) on Sep 25, 2017 at 9:13pm PDTIn January, the Washington Post published an op-ed in support of Kaepernick, penned by a class of fourth graders in New York City: The majority of Americans support these players. But you know what? Even more younger people than older people do. We believe this is because they are inspiring us by showing us their passion, and fighting for what’s right…The players are standing up — or kneeling down — to bring awareness to the problem of how African-Americans are treated in this country. Some police are not treating black people right — and there’s a long history to this.

54,"Students call for gun control outside the White House on Wednesday. Kara Voght/Mother JonesBusloads of teenagers arrived in Tallahassee overnight to continue their calls for gun control hundreds of miles from the site of a mass shooting that left 17 dead and 14 others injured at a Parkland, Fla. high school. On Wednesday, students from Parkland traveled to the state Capitol to meet with lawmakers and rally for changes to the state’s lax gun laws a day after the Florida House rejected a motion along party lines to take up a bill to ban assault rifles. Despite the setback, some students remain optimistic. Daniel Bishop, a student at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the New York Times that he thinks the shooting at his school represents a different moment than previous school shootings. “Sandy Hook, they were elementary kids who couldn’t stand up for themselves,” Bishop said. “Virginia Tech was 2007, a different time. But this one, I just have a gut feeling—something is going to change.” Over the next two weeks, the Republican-controlled legislature is expected to consider other proposals to bolster the state’s gun laws such as raising the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle to 21. Since the shooting last week, students have pressured lawmakers to act, led by members of “Never Again MSD,” a group of Stoneman Douglas students who say they will continue to call for expanded background checks and a ban on military-grade firearms. Florida Gov. Rick Scott is expected to meet with students at 5 p.m. today.  ""I did not wait out an hour, fearing for my life, just to watch yesterday, the horror of an overwhelming vote against a life-saving bill,"" student says https://t.co/Nn2QjsRD5R pic.twitter.com/Sd5cqpli1L— CBS News (@CBSNews) February 21, 2018""If we are going to protect our future, why are none of us protecting our children?"" student says.

In Chicago, students at several high schools said they planned to file out of school today to rally. “Our goal is not to stop students from walking out,” said Nathaniel Rouse, principal at Oak Park and River Forest High School, told faculty and staff. “They have a right to peacefully protest. Our goal is to ensure they are kept safe in the process.” Meanwhile, the head of Texas school district told parents in a letter that kids who decided to protest in the wake of the Florida shooting would face a three-day suspension, the Houston Chronicle reported. “Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,” Curtis Rhodes, superintendent of the Needville Independent School District, wrote. “We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved.”(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.12';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Thousands of high school students just walked out of class to demand tougher gun laws. ARE YOU LISTENING, Donald J. Trump??Posted by Mother Jones on Wednesday, February 21, 2018",1
55,"President Donald Trump was at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas on Wednesday visiting victims of Sunday’s mass shooting when a reporter asked him, “Do you think we have a gun violence problem?”“We’re not going to talk about that today,” Trump responded. “We won’t talk about that.”The day before, the White House had circulated talking points to Trump allies urging Republicans to resist new gun control measures that could arise in response to the massacre that left 59 dead and nearly 500 injured. “When it comes to gun control, let’s be clear: new laws won’t stop a mad man committed to harming innocent people,” the memo stated.Trump says he’ll discuss gun laws “as time goes on.” But everyone Mother Jones spoke with in Las Vegas the day of the president’s visit—on both sides of the debate—thinks the time for a conversation is now.On the northern fringe of the Vegas strip lies Las Vegas Gunfights, “a full contact gunfight arena” in which customers combine real guns, non-lethal ammo, and martial arts to battle each other in a warehouse with sand floors and stacks of barrels that can be used as weapons or for cover. “We’ve had six or seven guys knocked out this year,” says the owner—or, as he prefers, the “Commander of Chaos”—a former bounty hunter named Nephi Oliva. He said he’s an enigma to some people because he is an Afghan-American, born to a Muslim father and an American Mormon mother, who is an ardent Trump supporter and gun enthusiast. Still, he said, “While I support one particular viewpoint, we have other Americans who have other viewpoints, and their feelings are valid. They also want to be safe. And, frankly, I may disagree with them, but I also want them to be safe, too.”Standing in the entryway of the warehouse, where camouflage netting and gunfight posters drape the walls, Oliva said, “We can have these conversations now…This is a democracy.” He issued his own proposal for gun control: “First, take the guns away from the criminals—disarm them first. Then take the guns away from crooked police officers. Then take them away from crooked politicians, and tyrannical government officials. Once you’ve done all that, I will gladly hand my guns over.”Genghis Cohen, the owner of Machine Guns Vegas, where clients can shoot fully automatic Uzis and AK-47s and even fire off belt-fed machine guns from a helicopter, closed his range for two days following the massacre and voiced support for having frank discussions about gun regulation. “If we can change laws to make people safer, then why would we not do that?” he told the Guardian. “Someone’s got to say something because if we don’t we end up looking like a bunch of cockroaches scurrying for cover.”“Now is exactly the time,” Donna Waldron, 66, said at a rally for gun control at Las Vegas’ Sunset Park, where about 30 demonstrators gathered on Wednesday night. “On a sunny day, you don’t worry about the roof leaking. When the monsoon comes, you worry about the roof leaking. This is a monsoon of violence in our country. Sandy Hook, Charlottesville, Las Vegas, Texas—the gunning down of six police officers.”“If we have to wait until there isn’t a mass shooting to discuss this issue, we’ll be waiting forever,” said Jean Green Dunbar, 34, a Nevada state coordinator for the Women’s March on Washington who helped organize the rally. Last year, Dunbar canvassed for a ballot measure to enforce background checks on all gun sales. Nevada voters narrowly passed the measure, but state Republican leaders have continued to block its implementation. “Our attorney general, Adam Laxalt, refuses to enforce it,” Dunbar lamented. (In a speech at the NRA’s annual convention last April, Laxalt boasted of his role in opposing the measure’s passage and implementation.) “What we have in place, we need to enforce, and we can’t roll it back,” she said.Several gun owners showed up at the rally, including Waldron, who keeps her late husband’s pistol for protection, and Michael Hart, 69, who argued that a handgun or a regular rifle is perfectly sufficient to protect one’s home. “I think people should people be allowed to have guns,” he said, “but not military-style guns.”Several participants at the rally rejected the widespread perception that the gun debate breaks down along ideological lines, with liberals seeking tighter controls on guns and conservatives opposing them. “I have lots of family members that own weapons, that hunt, that are conservatives, that absolutely believe in gun control,” said Dunbar, adding, “We are not divided. Most Americans want these regulations.”According to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans from both major political parties support universal background checks, the creation of a federal database to track gun sales, and a ban on assault-style weapons.Even as the president and top Republican lawmakers in Washington remain reluctant to discuss the issue, there is bipartisan support for one new gun control measure: a bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would ban “bump stocks,” the type of device used by the Las Vegas gunman that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. On Wednesday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said he would likely support the legislation. “The fact that fully automatic weapons are already illegal and this makes another weapon capable [of automatic fire], I would be supportive of that,” he said. In an interview with Miami’s NPR affiliate, WLRN, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said, “Right now the best candidate for a common denominator is to focus on these bump stock devices, which are so deadly and so potent.” He added, “I’ve even spoken to people who are involved in the gun manufacturing business, and they have told me that these things should not be legal.”Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers have said they no longer expect a controversial bill that would deregulate gun silencers to come up for a full House vote. The legislation would remove silencers from the list of regulated items under the National Firearms Act of 1934, making their purchase subject only to an instant background check, or potentially to no regulation at all in states that don’t require background checks for private gun sales. On Tuesday morning, Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) told reporters, “I don’t think there’s any support to bring it up.”“A lot of people say they don’t want to roll back their Second Amendment rights,” said Deborah Johnson, one of the organizers of the gun control rally on Wednesday night. “Well, we don’t know how to control our Second Amendment rights. We abuse our Second Amendment rights. How many mass shootings have to happen before we have an honest conversation?”",1

Jonathan Mossberg wanted to be the Steve Jobs of firearms.In 1999, a few years before the invention of the iPod, Mossberg began to build the iGun, a computer-chip-equipped “smart gun” that could only be fired by its owner. (The “i” stands for intelligence.) He saw the technology as a commonsense way to prevent gun violence—a no-brainer safety device like seatbelts or air bags. The iGun is a shotgun equipped with a radio frequency identification (RFID) sensor that only allows it to be fired by someone wearing a special ring. By 2000, a fully functional version had endured a grueling round of military-grade testing and was ready to hit the market. “When I filed my patents, my patent attorney said, ‘You’ve got the next dot-com,'” Mossberg recalls. “He was blown away.”Mossberg wasn’t the first person to envision a smart gun, but he was well positioned to make it a reality. He was a scion of O.F. Mossberg & Sons, the nation’s oldest family-owned gun company, which makes one of the world’s best-selling lines of pump-action shotguns. He’d overseen manufacturing for the company and had also served as president of Uzi America, an importer of Israeli weapons.But the iGun hit a wall. Consumers were skeptical, in part because gun rights groups had been painting smart guns as a Trojan horse for gun grabbers. A few years earlier, gun manufacturer Colt had unveiled a smart-watch-activated pistol, and Smith & Wesson had pledged to explore “authorized user technology” for its weapons. Both projects were abandoned in the face of withering criticism from the National Rifle Association, which led a boycott of Smith & Wesson. In 2005, under pressure from the NRA, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, making gun manufacturers immune from lawsuits related to gun accidents or misuse—and removing another incentive to develop smart guns. (Today, the NRA says it doesn’t oppose smart guns but claims they are an attempt to make firearms more expensive and “would allow guns to be disabled remotely.”)Ever since, no major firearms maker has touched the smart-gun concept—including O.F. Mossberg & Sons. “They are doing so well that they have little to gain,” Mossberg says of his family’s company (which he left in 2000). Though they see the benefits of smart guns, “should this turn into a Smith & Wesson boycott-type thing, they don’t want to be associated with that. And I don’t blame them.”After shelving the iGun for more than a decade, Mossberg has reloaded. Americans’ trust in consumer electronics has grown, along with their concern about gun violence and safety. “The whole thing has gained a lot of momentum again,” says Mossberg, who today owns the exclusive rights to produce and market the iGun. He says he receives emails nearly every day asking about its price and availability.Silicon chips have shrunk to the point that Mossberg can produce a 9 mm handgun version of the iGun, tapping a much larger market. While O.F. Mossberg & Sons’ research once suggested that gun owners were skeptical of weapons containing circuit boards, a 2013 survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun manufacturers’ trade association, found that 14 percent of all gun owners were somewhat or very likely to buy smart guns. Though the NSSF spun those results as bad for smart guns, Mossberg sees an opportunity potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “I know lots of people who would love to get 14 percent of the firearms market,” he says. And new research shows the market could be much bigger. A nationally representative survey published by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in December found that nearly 60 percent of Americans, if they were to buy a new handgun, would be willing to purchase a smart gun.Police departments have also come around to the concept of issuing firearms that can’t be used by bad guys. More than 5 percent of officers killed in the line of duty are shot with their own weapons, often 9 mm handguns. In November, San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr told 60 Minutes that he wanted his officers to have the option to carry smart guns if they were available. More than a dozen law enforcement agencies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Florida have tested the iGun in recent months, according to Mossberg.Smart guns have also gained a powerful ally in Washington. In January, President Obama directed the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a strategy to promote smart gun research and expedite government procurement of the weapons.To bring a smart pistol to market, Mossberg says he needs to raise about $1 million for research and development—money that almost certainly won’t come from O.F. Mossberg & Sons or any other major firearms company. Following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway announced an effort to fund start-up companies dedicated to promoting gun safety. Conway’s Smart Tech Challenges Foundation gave Mossberg a grant of $100,000, which helped generate buzz for smart guns in the Valley. Yet nearly two years later, not a single venture capital firm has backed a smart-gun company. Margot Hirsch, the president of Smart Tech Challenges, says tech investors didn’t have smart guns on their radar in the past, but she hopes that now “the VC community and impact investors will be interested in investing, not only to make money, but to save lives.”Mossberg sees no reason why his product should be controversial. “In the 1700s and 1800s, there was still no manual safety device on a gun,” he observes, referring to the safety catches that are now ubiquitous on American handguns and rifles. “And then somebody put one on there and nobody cared. This is nothing more than that.”window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={""beacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""licenseKey"":""949ceaf672"",""applicationID"":""42428067"",""transactionName"":""MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMTD1VE"",""queueTime"":0,""applicationTime"":124,""atts"":""HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse"",""errorBeacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""agent"":""""}",1

In Orlando this afternoon, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with victims’ families and survivors of the massacre at the Pulse LGBT nightclub that claimed the lives of 49 people just days ago.Obama spoke about an increasingly urgent need for gun control legislation, saying “we need to work across political lines to do more to stop killers who want to terrorize us.”“The last two terrorist attacks on our soil—Orlando and San Bernardino—were homegrown,” he said. “Our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual…to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons…legally.”He insisted that the debate surrounding gun control needs to change, and called on the House and Senate to “rise to the moment and do the right thing” and pass legislation to curb access to weapons like the AR-15. “For so many [LGBT] people, the Pulse has been a safe haven…and on Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way possible,” Obama said. “Americans were targeted because we’re a country that’s learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.”Watch his remarks in full below:WATCH: President Obama’s full remarks after meeting with #Orlando shooting survivors and families of victims. https://t.co/qkyc0gPb3N	— ABC News (@ABC) June 16, 2016 ",1
59,"Yin Bogu/ZumaIt didn’t take long after the massacre in Orlando for the conversation to turn to gun control, especially considering the shooter allegedly used a weapon of war that he purchased legally just days before his attack on the gay nightclub.Is the worst mass shooting in history enough to finally move the needle on the gun control conversation? Time will tell. But an interesting perspective on the question comes via the team over at Google Trends, who have been crunching the search giant’s internal numbers on searches related to guns. Take a look how searches—represented on the maps below as ranked search terms within Google—have evolved over the last year, and even in the wake of the Orlando massacre.Here’s the 2015 average for the search terms “Gun control” and “Gun shop,” with each state colored by whichever term had a higher average search rank:You can see that “Gun shop” was the higher search term in most states in 2015, but that was starting to change in 2016. Take a look: But that’s changed in a big way since Orlando, where searches for “Gun control” dominate in every state except Kentucky:The “gun control” search term might have had a bounce post-Orlando since it’s a natural topic of conversation and one of the major news topics over the last few days and it is unclear whether a massacre of 49 mostly LGBTQ innocent people has inspired the population to take gun control more seriously. But maybe something is changing. Google Trends also looked at the same type of search traffic in the wake of other mass shootings, including after Oregon, Virginia, and Charleston. In those cases, search traffic for “Gun control” spiked only after Oregon: ",1
60,"In the wake of the worst mass shooting in US history, Jimmy Kimmel on Monday delivered a scathing monologue calling out congressional lawmakers who send their prayers instead of working for increased gun control measures. The Las Vegas native specifically called out President Trump and Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan for failing to act “because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.”“The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a number of other lawmakers who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip, also sent their thoughts and their prayers today—which is good,” Kimmel said.“They should be praying,” he continued. “They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country because it is so crazy.”Kimmel also showed the images of senators who just days after the Orlando shooting in June 2016 voted against a bill that would have closed certain gun sale loopholes. “These are the 56 senators who didn’t want to do anything about that,” he said.The powerful plea comes on the heels of similar emotional speeches from Kimmel over Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",1
61,"Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo at the March for Our Lives on March 24.David J. Phillip/APThe evening after a gunman killed 10 people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Houston police chief Art Acevedo took to Facebook to write an impassioned plea for gun control, writing that he had hit “rock bottom” after the massacre.“I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children,” Acevedo wrote in his post. “I know some have strong feelings about gun rights…I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue.”The Santa Fe High School shooting, 35 miles outside of Houston, is far from the first mass shooting to affect Texas cities in the past few years. Six months ago, 26 people were killed at the Texas First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. And in 2016, a gunman killed 5 police officers in Dallas. At least 99 people have died in 8 mass shootings in the state since 1984.Acevedo has called for stronger gun measures before, and on March 24 he joined in Houston’s March for Our Lives, one of many marches across the country spearheaded by teen survivors of the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.Here is his full Facebook post:To all my Facebook friends. Today I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children and a responding police officer who is clinging to life. I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve shed tears of sadness, pain and anger.I know some have strong feelings about gun rights but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue. Please do not post anything about guns aren’t the problem and there’s little we can do. My feelings won’t be hurt if you de-friend me and I hope yours won’t be if you decide to post about your views and I de-friend you.I have never accepted the status-quo in anything I do and I’ve never accepted defeat. And I won’t do it now. I will continue to speak up and will stand up for what my heart and my God commands me to do, and I assure you he hasn’t instructed me to believe that gun-rights are bestowed by him.The hatred being spewed in our country and the new norms we, so-called people of faith are accepting, is as much to blame for so much of the violence in our once pragmatic Nation.This isn’t a time for prayers, and study and Inaction, it’s a time for prayers, action and the asking of God’s forgiveness for our inaction (especially the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing).I close by saying, I wish those that move on from this page the best.

Even as the National Rifle Association celebrates Donald Trump’s victory, gun control advocates have something to smile about today. Of the four gun-related measures on state ballots this year, three passed.The only gun-related ballot measure not to win, Question 3 asked voters whether background checks should be required for private gun sales. If neither the buyer nor the seller is a licensed gun dealer, they’d have to go to a licensed dealer who would run a background check. The measure would have also required a background check for loaning guns, with exceptions for gun transfers between family members, emergency self-defense, and temporary transfers for hunting and sport shooting. Supporters, including Maine Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense Fund and Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership Fund, have spent $5.2 million to get the measure passed. Approximately $1 million was spent against it, the vast majority by the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action.Prop 63 passed easily, garnering 63 percent of the vote. It will ban certain types of semi-automatic assault rifles, require background checks for ammunition sales, outlaw magazines that carry more than 10 bullets, create a system for confiscating guns from felons, and require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. Major components of the initiative already became law earlier this year, and gun rights groups say they will challenge the overlapping laws in court. Opponents spent nearly $1 million against the measure to the nearly $4.5 million spent by supporters.Similar to Maine’s ballot initiative, Question 1 will require most gun sales, including private sales, to be subject to a background check. However, it narrowly passed by less than 10,000 votes. The same exemptions that Maine allows also apply here. Supporters spent more than $18 million and received significant financial backing from Everytown For Gun Safety. The NRA Nevadans for Gun Freedom and Nevadans for State Gun Rights spent nearly $6.5 million to sink the initiative. The NRA stuck to its usual script in opposing the measure, writing, “Question 1 does nothing to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms.”Initiative 1491 allows family, household members, and police to petition a judge to temporarily prohibit a person’s access to guns if that person is found to be a risk to himself or others. Petitions for an “extreme risk protection order” will last one year. Those under order can request a hearing to argue against the order. The NRA opposed the measure, saying that “if a person is truly dangerous, existing law already provides a variety of mechanisms to deal with the individual.” Nonetheless, it passed with 71 percent of the vote.",1

On Monday, the Senate failed to move forward two gun control measures aimed at expanding background checks and blocking individuals listed on terrorist watch lists from obtaining weapons. This outcome was widely expected, even after a 15-hour marathon filibuster staged by Senate Democrats urging their fellow lawmakers to act on gun control in the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history.As Samantha Bee noted on the latest Full Frontal on Monday, Republicans including “rodent-faced soup sponge” Sen. Ted Cruz, have dismissed calls for increased gun control since the Orlando mass shooting as nothing more than a political game and political correctness staged by Democrats. Much of this, as Bee explained, is the result of the strong grip the National Rifle Association has on Republican lawmakers. Watch above as she slams the GOP, or as Bee calls the party “puppets of the NRA,” in the segment above.",1
64,"ABC NewsFive students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, made their way through all the major morning talks shows Sunday, appearing on NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and CNN. They announced nationwide marches for gun control next month and ripped politicians, including President Donald Trump, who benefit from the National Rifle Association’s political spending while refusing to act to strengthen gun laws.“Now is the time to get on the right side of this,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the students, said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “Because this is not something we are going to be let [you] sweep under the carpet.” Gonzalez said she was speaking directly to Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), and other lawmakers who have benefited from pro-gun money.“These people who are being funded by the NRA are not going to be allowed to remain in office when midterm elections roll around,” she said. “They are going to be voted out of office.”Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Alex Wind, and Jaclyn Corin are among the survivors of the shooting that killed 17 people at the high school on Wednesday. They drew praise from network and cable news hosts as they offered pointed advice for lawmakers and older Americans.On Sunday afternoon, the White House announced that Trump will hold what it called a listening session on gun violence with high school students this coming Wednesday. The White House did not say which students Trump would meet with or if he would speak with the students organizing the marches. Some Stoneman Douglas students and parents have said they don’t want to meet with Trump, the Daily Beast reported Friday.“We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” Kasky said on CNN’s State of the Union.“This is about us begging for our lives,” Kasky said. “This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about us creating a badge of shame for any politicians accepting money from the NRA and using us as collateral.”The students said they are planning are series of demonstrations called “March for Our Lives” that will take place around the country on March 24. It will include a rally in Washington. Other students are planning a nationwide school walkout on April  20—the 19th anniversary of the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado—to highlight lawmakers’ failure to address the problem.“We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks,” Gonzalez said during a speech at a rally on Saturday. “Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because…we are going to be the last mass shooting.”Other students from the school on Sunday criticized Trump for a tweet in which he blamed the the ongoing Russia probe for the FBI’s failure to act on warnings about the alleged gunman. Trump’s tweet drew widespread condemnation.",1
65,"Semi-automatic rifles line the walls of a gun shop in Lynnwood, Washington.Elaine Thompson/APThe day after a new poll revealed that 95 percent of American voters support universal background checks for gun purchases—a record high—a bi-partisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to improve the federal background check system.The measure would not mandate a background check for every gun sale. The “compromise” legislation, as the senators put it, would instead focus on requiring state and federal agencies to do a better job of entering criminal history records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), as is already required by law. The Fix NICS Act would penalize federal agencies that fail to properly input records and incentivize states to improve their overall reporting.The group of seven senators sponsoring the bill is led by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who has an A+ rating from the NRA, and includes four Republicans and three Democrats—Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), all prominent gun safety advocates.“It’s no secret that I believe much more needs to be done,” Sen. Murphy said in a statement on Thursday. “But this bill will make sure that thousands of dangerous people are prevented from buying guns. It represents the strongest update to the background checks system in a decade, and provides the foundation for more compromise in the future.”The bill was inspired by an apparent loophole that came to light in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at a baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 dead earlier this month. The shooter had a history of domestic abuse; as a member of the Air Force, he’d been court-martialed for two charges of domestic assault, sentenced to 12 months of confinement, and was kicked out of the military in 2014 with a Bad Conduct Discharge. Technically, his crimes prevented him from legally buying a gun, but the Air Force never submitted the criminal records for the the NICS database, allowing him to pass a background check and purchase a gun. It’s unclear how frequently this occurs, but the Trace found that it may be a much wider problem than this isolated incident.“Mass murderers in Sutherland Springs, Charleston, and Blacksburg were legally prohibited from accessing firearms, but gaps in NICS allowed each of them to walk out of a gun store with the weapons used to commit their crimes,” said Sen. Blumenthal. He told the New York Times, “It may seem to many like a baby step, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and this one could well be important in breaking the ice of complicity that has paralyzed Congress.”This isn’t the first time that lawmakers have introduced a law to force federal agencies to better comply with existing gun-control laws. In 2007, the House voted to close a loophole that allowed the Virginia Tech gunman to purchase weapons despite having been committed to a mental hospital. It provided grant money for states to update the background checks database, adding more criminal records and mental health information, and was similarly viewed as a compromise bill between lawmakers with opposing political views. A co-sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), said at the time, “This act will ensure that the background check system really is instant and accurate.” There has been improvement in reporting on both criminal backgrounds and mental health since then, but ten years and several mass shootings later shows there is still much to be done.",1
66,"Gerrymandering activists gather outside the Supreme Court in March. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via APThe Supreme Court dealt a big blow Monday to efforts to combat racial gerrymandering, approving Texas’ GOP-drawn political maps that had previously been found to discriminate intentionally against minority voters. In a 5-4 ruling, the court upheld the state’s congressional and legislative maps, with the exception of the map of one state legislative district, which the court struck down for reducing the voting power of minority groups. The court’s decision overturns the findings of the federal district court in Texas, which had found not only that the Legislature had discriminated against minorities in drawing certain districts, but also that the discrimination was an intentional effort to “ensure Anglo control.” But the court’s conservative majority disagreed, reversing the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination.Justice Sonia Sotomoyor issued a blistering dissent, joined by the other liberal justices. This decision “comes at serious costs to our democracy,” she wrote. “It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas—despite constituting a majority of the population within the State—will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.” The Texas case presented a quandary for the Supreme Court. In 2013, the court gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act, eliminating the ability of the federal government to block state and local election laws that discriminated against minorities. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the country had changed, and that the racism that had pervaded election practices since the civil rights movement had dissipated. Texas challenged that narrative. The state has lost nine racial discrimination voting cases since 2011, with multiple judges finding that the discrimination was intentional—including in the political maps at issue in this case.The court’s decision Monday is in keeping with its 2013 ruling. Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the majority “blinds itself to the overwhelming factual record…to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.”This latest battle over Texas’ political maps began shortly after the last redistricting period following the 2010 census. Texas’ population had ballooned over the previous decade due to the state’s rapidly expanding minority population, and nearly 90 percent of Texas’ 4.3 million new residents were Latino or African American. As the fastest-growing state, Texas received four new congressional districts. But when the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political maps the following year, it created four new districts that were largely controlled by white voters. Latino and African American rights groups sued over the new maps.A federal court blocked the 2011 maps and hastily put in place a tweaked version ahead of the 2012 elections for Congress and the state Legislature. These maps were intended to be temporary. But as soon as the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Texas Republicans simply passed these temporary maps as the state’s new permanent maps. Minority rights groups, including the Texas branch of the NAACP and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, challenged these maps, arguing that they retained the bias of the blocked 2011 maps they were based on. Last year, a district court in San Antonio agreed, finding in two separate rulings that the 2011 and 2013 maps intentionally discriminated by weakening the voting power of black and Latino voters.Conservative justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for the majority in Monday’s ruling. In upholding Texas’ maps, he found fault in the district court’s analysis. “Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State,” he wrote. “In redistricting cases, the ‘good faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.'”  The court’s ruling will allow the Republican-drawn maps to remain in place through the 2020 elections, until the next round of redistricting takes place following the census that year. But even then, it could shape the next decade’s maps: The court’s ruling will likely be seen as an open invitation for Republicans to continue to weaken the voting power of minority, Democratic-leaning voters in Texas and across the country. ",1
67,"Brian Cahn/ZUMAPresident Donald Trump on Monday falsely accused Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) of attempting to incite violence against his supporters, warning the California lawmaker to “be careful what you wish for.” He also viciously branded Waters as being an “extremely low IQ person.”Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018The president’s tweet is a blatant misrepresentation of Waters’ actual comments, in which she recently urged Democrats to confront Trump administration officials in public with words of protest, not violence. “Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up,” Waters said at a rally in Los Angeles Saturday. “And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.”“Tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” she said, before speaking out against Trump’s immigration policy separating migrant children from their parents.Conservatives instantly seized on the remarks, which came amid a recent spate of public protests against Trump officials inside privately owned restaurants. The latest involved White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday, when the owner of a Lexington, Virginia, restaurant asked her to leave over the Trump administration’s “inhumane” policies.Adding to the misrepresentations Monday, Trump also appeared to accuse House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of supporting Waters’ remarks moments after Pelosi did exactly the opposite.In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again. Trump’s daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable.

68,"Harley Rouda for CongressDemocratic congressional candidate Harley Rouda will challenge incumbent Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher this November in an attempt to flip California’s 48th Congressional district from red to blue. Rouda’s competitor, stem cell scientist Hans Kierstead, has conceded the second place spot in California’s “top-two” primary to Rouda, according to Rouda’s Twitter account.The concession comes after a weekslong, and yet still unfinished, vote count by the Orange County Registrar of Voters. In the days immediately following the election, Kierstead held a narrow lead over Rouda, a real estate investor. As OC workers slowly worked their way through the ballots, Rouda gained on, and eventually surpassed, Kierstead. As of Sunday, Rouda held a 126 vote lead over Kierstead.  I just got off the phone with @drhanskeirstead. We congratulated each other on a hard fought primary and he pledged his full support to our campaign to #flipthe48th and defeat @RepRohrabacher. #ThankYouHans— Harley Rouda (@HarleyRouda) June 25, 2018As in six other Republican-held districts across California, more residents of Rohrabacher’s south Orange County district supported Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Demographically, the district has a slight white majority, but about 40 percent of the its residents are either Latino or Asian. Its median annual household income is a healthy $89,000.Heading into the June 5 primary, many worried that California’s uncommon top-two “jungle primary”—where the top-two primary vote-getters, regardless of party, duke it out in the November general election—could conceivably have lead to Democrats getting locked out of the November general election.That didn’t happen. On June 6, Democrats let out a sigh of relief as it became clear they had avoided a lock-out in all the in-play districts. But in California’s 48th, the question of which Democrat would advance wasn’t clear until 19 days after the election.Though Rouda will likely tap broad Democratic financial support on his path to the November general election, his primary victory is basically the result a coin flip. The California State Democratic Party voted in February to endorse Keirstead, but the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) opted to spend money boosting Rouda in the days before the primary election.Incidentally, the DCCC also spent more than $100,000 boosting a lower polling Republican candidate John Gabbard, presumably to siphon votes away from another, stronger candidate Scott Baugh, to decrease the likelihood of Democrats getting shut out of the November general election, according to Open Secrets.In the primary, both Rouda and Keirstead ran on progressive platforms. If elected, Rouda has pledged to advocate for Medicare for all.",1
69,"February 21, 2018 - Washington, District of Columbia - Students from the DC area walk out of class to demand gun control legislation at a gathering outside the White House. Erin Scott/ZUMA WireFollowing the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month, all eyes are on the students who have garnered an unprecedented amount of national attention from their calls for gun control. In the couple of weeks since the shooting, the students have grilled politicians on live television, mocked conspiracy theorists on Twitter, and inspired hundreds of people across the country to demand action from their state legislators and from Washington.Three major national protests are already in the works and will take place over the next few months, adding to a regular stream of local activism. Here’s a look at what to expect:March 14: “Enough” national school walk outWith leadership from the Women’s March organizers, students and teachers across the country are planning “Enough“—a national school walkout scheduled for March 14.According to the event’s Facebook page, the walk out will begin at 10 a.m. in each time zone and last for 17 minutes, one minute for every victim who died in the Parkland shooting; 33,000 people have RSVP-ed on Facebook that they will attend. Dozens of schools are listed on the Enough homepage as participating.“We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns. Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that address the public health crisis of gun violence,” the organizers write on the march’s homepage. “We want Congress to pay attention and take note: many of us will vote this November and many others will join in 2020.”March 24: March For Our LivesTen days later, on March 24, the “March For Our Lives” will descend on Washington, D.C. The organizing for this rally began with survivors of the Parkland shooting but now involves students nationwide. Their goal is to demand that a “comprehensive and effective bill be immediately” introduced in Congress to address gun violence. “March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar,” the organizers write on their website. “In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut short in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March For Our Lives believes the time is now.” This march gained additional notoriety last week when celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and George Clooney each promised to donate $500,000 to the march. According to the Washington Post, organizers expect nearly 500,000 attendees in Washington. There will also be dozens of sister marches across the country. April 20: National High School WalkoutOn the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, another national walk out will take place—this one organized by Lane Murdock, a 15 year-old high school student in Connecticut, to protest gun violence in schools and inaction by lawmakers.Murdock created a petition on Change.org to publicize the walk-out: “Public school shootings affect communities and especially teenagers,” she wrote. “On February, 14th a High School shooting in Parkland, Florida occurred, killing 17 people. Still, POTUS has not addressed any form of gun legislation. The majority of teenagers have no right to vote, leaving our voice unheard.” Around 200,000 people have signed the petition online, committing to walk out of their schools on April 20, and teachers across the country are planning to join. According to the Hartford Courant, students will also stand in silence for 17 minutes for each victim of the tragedy. Are there other protests being planned, perhaps in your local area?

70,"Oliver Contreras/SIPA USA via APPresident Trump is finally talking about gun control three days after a mass shooting that left 17 people dead and injured at least 14 others at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The president was silent about the issue in a speech at the White House on Thursday, where he offered condolences to the families of the students and teachers murdered and said he would meet with lawmakers and others to discuss school safety. He also visited victims and their families in Broward County on Friday. On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted:Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018In terms of partisan politics, tighter gun regulations have long been much more favored by Democrats than Republicans, but two gun control measures failed to pass in the Senate in 2013, when Democrats held the majority. Last year, Trump revoked an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase guns.In the wake of the mass shooting this week, outraged students in Florida and elsewhere have demanded that politicians take action on gun control.",1
71,"Jose Luis Magana/APOne month after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students from across the country walked out of class to protest Congress’ inaction on gun violence. And as they did, Congress responded—sort of. With teenagers demonstrating outside the Capitol, both the House and Senate on Wednesday made vague efforts to deal with school safety issues, holding votes and hearings that attempted to address the matter without actually tightening gun laws.Fix this before I text my mom from under a desk #NationalSchoolWalkout pic.twitter.com/bk820wL7Kt— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018In the House, members voted to pass the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that reauthorizes a 2001 Justice Department program designed to prevent school violence. It provides $50 million in federal funding to help schools train staff in identifying mental health issues and violent behavior; establish an anonymous reporting system; and pay for school security measures, such as metal detectors and locks. The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, includes no gun-related provisions. And while it received overwhelming bipartisan support―only 10 members opposed it―Democrats have sharply criticized GOP lawmakers for not doing more to curtail access to guns.The bill represents the first major vote on school safety since the February shooting in Parkland, but it was not originally a reaction to the massacre. A bipartisan group of lawmakers―including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), who represents Parkland―introduced the bill at the end of January, and it had received support from anti-school-violence groups at that time. Deutch told Politico that “it is in no way a response to Stoneman Douglas and does not address the gun violence epidemic in our country.” Following the shooting, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced companion legislation in the Senate, where it was met with similarly broad, bipartisan support.Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2018In the Senate, the Judiciary committee held a hearing Wednesday to investigate the failures of federal authorities to effectively respond to warning signs displayed by the Florida gunman. Senators took the opportunity to grill FBI Acting Deputy Director David Bowdich on the White House’s gun and school safety proposals and to ask about other potential reform measures. Bowdich―who’s held the job since the end of January, following the resignation of Andrew McCabe―seemed to leave at least some lawmakers unsatisfied.For example, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) brought up Trump’s proposal for arming teachers and pointed to research showing that harsh school discipline often disproportionately affects students of color. When Harris asked Bowdich if the White House plan would include implicit bias training designed to prevent teachers from shooting innocent students, Bowdich said, “I never really put the two together.”Officials from the Secret Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives received a similar reception from lawmakers when they failed to answer questions about the efficacy of student risk assessments and background checks for gun sales. And incredibly, none of the three executive branch representatives were familiar with the Dickey Amendment, federal legislation that prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding public health research into gun violence.Members of the Parkland community also weighed in at the hearing, including Stoneman Douglas teacher Katherine Posada and Ryan Petty, the father of a student killed in the shooting. Petty urged Congress to follow the example of lawmakers in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott (R) just signed a package of bipartisan gun restrictions over the objections of the National Rifle Association. The Florida legislation established a three-day waiting period for gun sales, raised the minimum age for all gun purchases to 21, and provided $400 million for mental health services and school safety resources, such as bulletproof glass and metal detectors. Petty said he hopes to spend Thursday meeting with Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss how the parties could find common ground on the issue.The march is on the way to the Capitol building #nationalschoolwalkout pic.twitter.com/KdeOuCnVcY— Nathalie Baptiste (@nhbaptiste) March 14, 2018Despite the calls from students and activists across the country, no gun control measures have gained any traction in Congress in the month since the Parkland shooting—repeating a pattern that has persisted since the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. As that stalemate continues, Congress’ school safety conversations will proceed. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) says the House plans to hold its own oversight hearing on the FBI’s failures to investigate the Florida gunman prior to the shooting. And next week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is expected to appear before two House committees to discuss the White House’s plans to address gun violence.",1
72,"Royce Christensen, Las Vegas massacre survivor, attends his first gun safety rally.Mother Jones/Al Kamalizad“Damn!” says Royce Christensen, 22, beaming at his mother, Darla, as they troop through Saturday’s March for Our Lives demonstration in Salt Lake City, Utah. They make their way along the route from West High School to the steps of the state Capitol building, and the crowd chants, “Vote them out!” It’s a huge turnout. “And this is a red state!” Christensen exclaims.“Imagine what D.C. is like,” replies Darla.“Yeah,” Christensen nods. “D.C.”Royce wore a T-shirt to the march that identifies who he is: “Survivor,” it reads. “#VegasStrong.” Nearly six months ago, Royce and several members of his family were working as security guards at the Route 91 musical festival in Las Vegas when a barrage of bullets rained down in what would come to be known as the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Royce felt the bullets zipping overhead, kicking up shards of aluminum as they hit the stage. He saw people drop.And so on the cusp of the half-year anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre, we traveled with Christensen and his family as they drove north from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah, where they met up with Christensen’s fiancé to attend the March for Our Lives rally. It’s the first political rally that Christensen has ever marched in. On the drive up, he had said he wanted to “make something happen” after the Vegas shooting, and when he saw “the opportunity join something that seems to actually be gaining traction, that seems to be gripping onto the steps of the government for once,” he had to be part of it.He began the morning “ready for this,” but also nervous. He’d heard that there would be a counter-protest and that some of those demonstrators would be carrying weapons. He was also nervous that his ideas about gun control wouldn’t entirely align with those expressed at the rally. He’s had fun target shooting in the past. He doesn’t want the Second Amendment abolished. On the one hand, “Guns are awesome,” he says. On the other: “They need to be controlled.”Mother Jones first met Christensen two days after the Las Vegas massacre last October at a candlelit vigil, where he told the story of how he had tried to keep people calm and hidden as the gunfire blared on. When it was finally over, thousands of bullets and 10 long minutes later, he saw a truck, its bed filled with the wounded, speeding toward a hospital. The concert ground was “a maze of bodies.”“As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now.”Christensen wasn’t hit with a bullet during the Las Vegas massacre, but he’s been suffering ever since. He has a hard time sleeping, and when he does, his sleep is filled with nightmares. Tall buildings and balconies that someone could fire from make him nervous. When a car backfires or someone lights fireworks—not uncommon occurrences in Las Vegas, where he lives—he reacts, diving behind his bed or running through the house, switching off lights and pulling down blinds. He takes medicine for post-traumatic stress and sees a therapist at least once a week. Christensen has the rare gift of photographic memory, but nowadays, it feels like a curse. “As much as my photographic memory has helped me in the past, it’s really kicking my ass now,” he says.At the rally, there’s a booming crowd of “people who care about what has happened,” he says. “I thought maybe 30, 50 people [would show up]. I think this is at least 400 people already. I did not think this many would show up at all.”He’s looked at the signs people carry and has listened to their goals for gun safety, and their fight for gun control doesn’t feel too extreme for him.”These people want common sense changes,” he says. “They don’t want to get rid of the Second Amendment.”If the counter-protestors are here with their guns, he doesn’t see them.As protesters chant, “Enough is enough!” and “Never Again!” he chants with them. When he meets other attendees, he introduces himself as a “proud survivor of the worst mass shooting in modern American history” and tells them that he’s marching with the hope that there will never be a new “worst mass shooting” again.Once the march reaches the Capitol building, Royce sits with his fiancé and his mother on the steps, facing a crowd that has grown to 8,000 people. While they listen to speeches from the student organizers, he and Darla lock eyes, and Darla weeps.After the last speech ends and the plaza clears, Christensen remains on the steps, awestruck. “I have not seen this kind of motivation before,” he says. “This is something new; I can feel it in the air.”Prior to the trip to Salt Lake City, Christensen sent a note to Mother Jones, full with anger, but also hope: “Pardon my French but when the worst shooting in United States history happened absolutely fucking nothing was done. When the church shooting that soon followed again absolutely nothing happened government-wise. Now after the Florida school shooting a large outcry is finally loud enough and has the staying power. I want to make sure that everyone remembers all the lives lost. I think this time these kids might change the world.”Now, after the rally, he’s even more hopeful and motivated. “This is change coming.”",1
73,"During a televised meeting with Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House, President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to broadly support a wide range of initiatives aimed at preventing future mass shootings. They ranged from endorsing stronger background checks to implementing “offensive” capabilities inside schools.One of the most striking moments came when it became increasingly clear that Trump was unfamiliar with the contents of the Manchin-Toomey bill, which famously failed to pass the Senate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. The 2013 legislation, which focused on expanding background checks and was strongly supported by then-President Barack Obama, marks the closest Congress has come in recent years to passing meaningful gun-control legislation. The speech Obama gave in response to the bill’s failure is regarded as his angriest public display. But on Wednesday, Trump appeared to blame his predecessor for the bill’s failure. It was just one of several times the president seemed to suggest that Obama didn’t push hard enough on gun control while in office. Trump also accused Toomey, who was in the room for Wednesday’s meeting, of being “afraid of the NRA” for not including language to raise the minimum age to purchase certain weapons.Sen. Pat Toomey tells President Trump that the Manchin-Toomey bill doesn’t deal with raising age limits from 18 to 21 to buy certain weapons.Trump: “You know why, because you are afraid of the NRA” https://t.co/vGNDzAlLt0— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 28, 2018At another point, Trump said he supported illegally seizing firearms from potential killers first, and then dealing with the due process. “I like taking the guns early,” he said in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s suggestion to do the exact opposite.WATCH: President Trump: ""I like taking the guns early … Take the guns first, go through due process second."" pic.twitter.com/aydEZdAGq0— NBC News (@NBCNews) February 28, 2018Trump later raised eyebrows when he suggested that a ban on assault weapons should also be included in the Manchin-Toomey bill. The surprising proposal was reminiscent of the January meeting at which lawmakers from both parties came together with the president to talk about immigration, and Trump agreed with Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s push for a clean bill on DACA. (Trump, of course, quickly backtracked, and later sought to kill a bipartisan bill many observers considered Congress’ best shot at a DACA resolution.)Nevertheless, Feinstein, who was sitting next to Trump at Wednesday’s meeting, looked quite pleased with Trump’s recommendation on assault weapons.Feinstein's reaction when Trump says she should add assault weapons ban to Manchin-Toomey pic.twitter.com/7dlKxwa1KO— Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) February 28, 2018",1

Gabrielle Giffords, Americans took a fatalistic view of whether anything could be done to stop future mass shootings. A CNN poll at the time showed that voters believed by a 2-1 margin that there was nothing the government could do to prevent future attacks. Seven years later, that’s all changed. A new poll released by CNN on Sunday found that 64 percent of American voters now believe the government can “take action that will be effective” in preventing mass shootings in the future. Only 32 percent believe that such attacks will happen “regardless” of government action. The poll comes a week and a half after the Feb 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida left 17 dead.Here’s how the new numbers compare to poll results after previous mass shootings:if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""]={},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas={""100"":437,""200"":312,""300"":262,""400"":262,""500"":237,""700"":237,""800"":212,""900"":212,""1000"":212},window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-xnxBM""),window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""xnxBM""==b)window.datawrapper[""xnxBM""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});What’s more, Americans are remarkably clear on exactly which steps they want the government to take. According to a separate poll released Sunday, conducted by USA Today/Suffolk University:Of course, just because people believe that government action would be effective, doesn’t mean they have confidence the government will act. Only about 1 in 5 respondents in the USA Today poll believe that Congress will take action on gun control: 28 percent of Republicans, and 14 percent of Democrats.Since the shooting, teen survivors of the tragedy continue to drum up national attention on the issue; the most famous of the bunch, Emma González, now has more Twitter followers than the National Rifle Association. But as Republican members of Congress return after a 10-day break, the Associated Press reports, they don’t appear to have much in the works. Even the most likely path forward—a modest bill to improve the accuracy of the federal background check system—has stalled, because it’s tied to a pro-gun plan to allow gun permits in one state to be recognized in all other states.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is earning some of his worst job approval marks of his presidency. Just 38 percent of voters currently approve of Trump’s job performance, the USA Today poll found—the lowest the president has ever scored, by their measure. According to Sunday’s CNN poll, Trump’s approval rating is down to 35 percent.",1

Andy Katz/APAfter the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last week, it quickly became clear that it wouldn’t be politicians or veteran activists leading the effort to demand action against gun violence—it would be students. Calls for action from the Stoneman Douglas students and their peers across the country have received an outpouring of support in the form of national attention and celebrity donations: Just this week, George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey each pledged to donate $500,000 to the March for Our Lives, a group “created and led” by kids to organize a national protest against gun violence on March 24 in Washington, D.C.

The following morning, Obama praised the young folks in a tweet: “How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We’ve been waiting for you.” But as Roxane Gay, a celebrated American writer, pointed out on Twitter, this is not the first time kids have been doing the hard work of political organizing and protest in the wake of trauma.  It is interesting to note the difference in support for the kids in FL versus the kids in Black Lives Matter. I say that with full admiration for the kids in FL, to survive such a trauma and fight for everyone to be safer. But that’s also what was happening in Ferguson and beyond— roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2018Gay is, of course, correct. Throughout history, kids from all backgrounds have been crucial in the fight for social justice. Child Labor ProtestsIn 1903, prominent labor organizer Mary Harris “Mother” Jones (who is also the namesake of this magazine) marched from Philadelphia to New York City with 400 “juvenile workers” to protest child labor in textile mills. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the “‘children’s army’…made frequent stops to give speeches and to show the public the effects of exploitation, as many of the children marching were permanently maimed, which provided real proof of the dangers of their employment.” Mother Jones and her “army” of textile workers on their march from Philadelphia to New York City to protest child labor.Library of Congress, Pierce & JonesA few years later, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York “passed the nation’s first true child labor laws,” the Inquirer reports. Teenagers and children played a major role throughout the civil rights movement. In 1955, before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., another young woman by the name of Claudette Colvin did the same thing—except she was 15 years old. After she was arrested and sent to jail, Colvin became one of the four plaintiffs in the Browder v. Gayle Supreme Court case, which ultimately desegregated buses in Alabama.In 1957, the governor of Arkansas dispatched the state national guard to prevent the students who went down in history as the Little Rock Nine from attending a newly integrated high school. President Eisenhower sent 1,200 soldiers to protect them later that month. In spite of daily threats and violence, the students attended the school for the full year.Less than a decade after that, thousands of children and teenagers protested segregation by marching across Birmingham, Ala., on May 2, 1963. Hundreds of black children were arrested and crowded into the local jails. The next day, on orders from a city official, police sprayed the children who continued to march with water hoses and hit them with batons. They kept going anyway.Over 1000 children and teens were arrested in protests on May 2, 1963 in Birmingham.

We hated the system. That’s what we were protesting about.”Eight days later, civil rights leaders announced that they had come to an agreement with city officials: Birmingham would desegregate businesses and release the detained protesters.Two months after that, President Kennedy took to national television to denounce segregation and propose new civil rights legislation.As Gay noted, children and teenagers have also been heavily involved in the Black Lives Matter movement since its inception. In 2014, for example, after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, black kids were heavily present in the protests that became a major turning point for the movement. Children watch from their home as people march to protest the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Many residents of the St. Louis suburb have said they feel like they are living in a war zone following the shooting of Michael Brown by police. Charlie Riedel / Associated PressParents across the country recognized the historical importance of the moment and wanted their children to bear witness.“It was important for them to be there,” Kendra Pierson, who brought her sons to an Atlanta vigil to honor Brown, told Huffington Post. “When they look back, in 10 years or five years, I want them to know they were there.” Pierson’s children were six and two years old at the time.Protester Janelle Pittman holds her 6-year-old daughter, Kat, as police in riot gear stand guard in Ferguson, Mo. on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014.Jeff Roberson / Associated Press.Their activism has continued on through the present.As demonstrators begin to gather, children and adults hold signs during a rally Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2014, in Charlotte, N.C. to protest the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer for the death of Michael Brown. John D.

The school, which is less than 5 percent black, has received some backlash, but school officials say they’ve received overwhelming support from the community. Lisa Rathke / Associated PressAfter Oprah Winfrey tweeted that she would be donating $500,000 to the “March For Our Lives,” Charlene Carruthers, national director of Black Youth Project 100, tweeted her support and made a point similar to Gay’s. Gosh. This is amazing. And a I’m not being sarcastic. I have to be honest and say that I’m a bit taken aback (and a bit hurt) that those of us who were in the streets in the past five years for Black lives didn’t receive this type of reception or public support. https://t.co/HLYXTcVdfL— Charlene Carruthers (@CharleneCac) February 21, 2018I promise y’all.

Soon enough, high school and college students across the country were following his lead. Before tonight’s Oakland A’s game, the OUSD Honor Band played the national anthem. And because of the heated national debate over racial justice, the students decided to take a knee for the whole song. They said they were protesting racism, police brutality and President Trump for saying what he did about protesting @nfl players who take a knee. See the video on the OUSD Facebook page. #iamOUSDA post shared by  Oakland School District (@ousdnews) on Sep 25, 2017 at 9:13pm PDTIn January, the Washington Post published an op-ed in support of Kaepernick, penned by a class of fourth graders in New York City: The majority of Americans support these players. But you know what? Even more younger people than older people do. We believe this is because they are inspiring us by showing us their passion, and fighting for what’s right…The players are standing up — or kneeling down — to bring awareness to the problem of how African-Americans are treated in this country. Some police are not treating black people right — and there’s a long history to this.

That night of protest set off a series of rallies, organized by far-right extremists and white supremacists. Young people nationwide showed up to counter-protest these rallies, which sometimes turned violent—in Charlottesville, a “Unite the Right” rally left one young woman dead and 19 people injured.These are literally young UVA students age 17-23 standing up to a sea of white supremacists and neo-Nazis surrounding them #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/VEU3mU9d3o— sophia_armen (@SophiaArmen) August 12, 2017In Berkeley, protests continued in August, when a small number of right-wing protesters were overwhelmed by thousands of peaceful counter-protesters.

77,"Students call for gun control outside the White House on Wednesday. Kara Voght/Mother JonesBusloads of teenagers arrived in Tallahassee overnight to continue their calls for gun control hundreds of miles from the site of a mass shooting that left 17 dead and 14 others injured at a Parkland, Fla. high school. On Wednesday, students from Parkland traveled to the state Capitol to meet with lawmakers and rally for changes to the state’s lax gun laws a day after the Florida House rejected a motion along party lines to take up a bill to ban assault rifles. Despite the setback, some students remain optimistic. Daniel Bishop, a student at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the New York Times that he thinks the shooting at his school represents a different moment than previous school shootings. “Sandy Hook, they were elementary kids who couldn’t stand up for themselves,” Bishop said. “Virginia Tech was 2007, a different time. But this one, I just have a gut feeling—something is going to change.” Over the next two weeks, the Republican-controlled legislature is expected to consider other proposals to bolster the state’s gun laws such as raising the minimum age to purchase an assault rifle to 21. Since the shooting last week, students have pressured lawmakers to act, led by members of “Never Again MSD,” a group of Stoneman Douglas students who say they will continue to call for expanded background checks and a ban on military-grade firearms. Florida Gov. Rick Scott is expected to meet with students at 5 p.m. today.  ""I did not wait out an hour, fearing for my life, just to watch yesterday, the horror of an overwhelming vote against a life-saving bill,"" student says https://t.co/Nn2QjsRD5R pic.twitter.com/Sd5cqpli1L— CBS News (@CBSNews) February 21, 2018""If we are going to protect our future, why are none of us protecting our children?"" student says.

Our goal is to ensure they are kept safe in the process.” Meanwhile, the head of Texas school district told parents in a letter that kids who decided to protest in the wake of the Florida shooting would face a three-day suspension, the Houston Chronicle reported. “Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,” Curtis Rhodes, superintendent of the Needville Independent School District, wrote. “We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved.”(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.12';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Thousands of high school students just walked out of class to demand tougher gun laws. ARE YOU LISTENING, Donald J. Trump??Posted by Mother Jones on Wednesday, February 21, 2018",1
78,"President Donald Trump was at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas on Wednesday visiting victims of Sunday’s mass shooting when a reporter asked him, “Do you think we have a gun violence problem?”“We’re not going to talk about that today,” Trump responded. “We won’t talk about that.”The day before, the White House had circulated talking points to Trump allies urging Republicans to resist new gun control measures that could arise in response to the massacre that left 59 dead and nearly 500 injured. “When it comes to gun control, let’s be clear: new laws won’t stop a mad man committed to harming innocent people,” the memo stated.Trump says he’ll discuss gun laws “as time goes on.” But everyone Mother Jones spoke with in Las Vegas the day of the president’s visit—on both sides of the debate—thinks the time for a conversation is now.On the northern fringe of the Vegas strip lies Las Vegas Gunfights, “a full contact gunfight arena” in which customers combine real guns, non-lethal ammo, and martial arts to battle each other in a warehouse with sand floors and stacks of barrels that can be used as weapons or for cover. “We’ve had six or seven guys knocked out this year,” says the owner—or, as he prefers, the “Commander of Chaos”—a former bounty hunter named Nephi Oliva. He said he’s an enigma to some people because he is an Afghan-American, born to a Muslim father and an American Mormon mother, who is an ardent Trump supporter and gun enthusiast. Still, he said, “While I support one particular viewpoint, we have other Americans who have other viewpoints, and their feelings are valid. They also want to be safe. And, frankly, I may disagree with them, but I also want them to be safe, too.”Standing in the entryway of the warehouse, where camouflage netting and gunfight posters drape the walls, Oliva said, “We can have these conversations now…This is a democracy.” He issued his own proposal for gun control: “First, take the guns away from the criminals—disarm them first. Then take the guns away from crooked police officers. Then take them away from crooked politicians, and tyrannical government officials. Once you’ve done all that, I will gladly hand my guns over.”Genghis Cohen, the owner of Machine Guns Vegas, where clients can shoot fully automatic Uzis and AK-47s and even fire off belt-fed machine guns from a helicopter, closed his range for two days following the massacre and voiced support for having frank discussions about gun regulation. “If we can change laws to make people safer, then why would we not do that?” he told the Guardian. “Someone’s got to say something because if we don’t we end up looking like a bunch of cockroaches scurrying for cover.”“Now is exactly the time,” Donna Waldron, 66, said at a rally for gun control at Las Vegas’ Sunset Park, where about 30 demonstrators gathered on Wednesday night. “On a sunny day, you don’t worry about the roof leaking. When the monsoon comes, you worry about the roof leaking. This is a monsoon of violence in our country. Sandy Hook, Charlottesville, Las Vegas, Texas—the gunning down of six police officers.”“If we have to wait until there isn’t a mass shooting to discuss this issue, we’ll be waiting forever,” said Jean Green Dunbar, 34, a Nevada state coordinator for the Women’s March on Washington who helped organize the rally. Last year, Dunbar canvassed for a ballot measure to enforce background checks on all gun sales. Nevada voters narrowly passed the measure, but state Republican leaders have continued to block its implementation. “Our attorney general, Adam Laxalt, refuses to enforce it,” Dunbar lamented. (In a speech at the NRA’s annual convention last April, Laxalt boasted of his role in opposing the measure’s passage and implementation.) “What we have in place, we need to enforce, and we can’t roll it back,” she said.Several gun owners showed up at the rally, including Waldron, who keeps her late husband’s pistol for protection, and Michael Hart, 69, who argued that a handgun or a regular rifle is perfectly sufficient to protect one’s home. “I think people should people be allowed to have guns,” he said, “but not military-style guns.”Several participants at the rally rejected the widespread perception that the gun debate breaks down along ideological lines, with liberals seeking tighter controls on guns and conservatives opposing them. “I have lots of family members that own weapons, that hunt, that are conservatives, that absolutely believe in gun control,” said Dunbar, adding, “We are not divided. Most Americans want these regulations.”According to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans from both major political parties support universal background checks, the creation of a federal database to track gun sales, and a ban on assault-style weapons.Even as the president and top Republican lawmakers in Washington remain reluctant to discuss the issue, there is bipartisan support for one new gun control measure: a bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would ban “bump stocks,” the type of device used by the Las Vegas gunman that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. On Wednesday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said he would likely support the legislation. “The fact that fully automatic weapons are already illegal and this makes another weapon capable [of automatic fire], I would be supportive of that,” he said. In an interview with Miami’s NPR affiliate, WLRN, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said, “Right now the best candidate for a common denominator is to focus on these bump stock devices, which are so deadly and so potent.” He added, “I’ve even spoken to people who are involved in the gun manufacturing business, and they have told me that these things should not be legal.”Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers have said they no longer expect a controversial bill that would deregulate gun silencers to come up for a full House vote. The legislation would remove silencers from the list of regulated items under the National Firearms Act of 1934, making their purchase subject only to an instant background check, or potentially to no regulation at all in states that don’t require background checks for private gun sales. On Tuesday morning, Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) told reporters, “I don’t think there’s any support to bring it up.”“A lot of people say they don’t want to roll back their Second Amendment rights,” said Deborah Johnson, one of the organizers of the gun control rally on Wednesday night. “Well, we don’t know how to control our Second Amendment rights. We abuse our Second Amendment rights. How many mass shootings have to happen before we have an honest conversation?”",1

Jonathan Mossberg wanted to be the Steve Jobs of firearms.In 1999, a few years before the invention of the iPod, Mossberg began to build the iGun, a computer-chip-equipped “smart gun” that could only be fired by its owner. (The “i” stands for intelligence.) He saw the technology as a commonsense way to prevent gun violence—a no-brainer safety device like seatbelts or air bags. The iGun is a shotgun equipped with a radio frequency identification (RFID) sensor that only allows it to be fired by someone wearing a special ring. By 2000, a fully functional version had endured a grueling round of military-grade testing and was ready to hit the market. “When I filed my patents, my patent attorney said, ‘You’ve got the next dot-com,'” Mossberg recalls. “He was blown away.”Mossberg wasn’t the first person to envision a smart gun, but he was well positioned to make it a reality. He was a scion of O.F. Mossberg & Sons, the nation’s oldest family-owned gun company, which makes one of the world’s best-selling lines of pump-action shotguns. He’d overseen manufacturing for the company and had also served as president of Uzi America, an importer of Israeli weapons.But the iGun hit a wall. Consumers were skeptical, in part because gun rights groups had been painting smart guns as a Trojan horse for gun grabbers. A few years earlier, gun manufacturer Colt had unveiled a smart-watch-activated pistol, and Smith & Wesson had pledged to explore “authorized user technology” for its weapons. Both projects were abandoned in the face of withering criticism from the National Rifle Association, which led a boycott of Smith & Wesson. In 2005, under pressure from the NRA, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, making gun manufacturers immune from lawsuits related to gun accidents or misuse—and removing another incentive to develop smart guns. (Today, the NRA says it doesn’t oppose smart guns but claims they are an attempt to make firearms more expensive and “would allow guns to be disabled remotely.”)Ever since, no major firearms maker has touched the smart-gun concept—including O.F. Mossberg & Sons. “They are doing so well that they have little to gain,” Mossberg says of his family’s company (which he left in 2000). Though they see the benefits of smart guns, “should this turn into a Smith & Wesson boycott-type thing, they don’t want to be associated with that. And I don’t blame them.”After shelving the iGun for more than a decade, Mossberg has reloaded. Americans’ trust in consumer electronics has grown, along with their concern about gun violence and safety. “The whole thing has gained a lot of momentum again,” says Mossberg, who today owns the exclusive rights to produce and market the iGun. He says he receives emails nearly every day asking about its price and availability.Silicon chips have shrunk to the point that Mossberg can produce a 9 mm handgun version of the iGun, tapping a much larger market. While O.F. Mossberg & Sons’ research once suggested that gun owners were skeptical of weapons containing circuit boards, a 2013 survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun manufacturers’ trade association, found that 14 percent of all gun owners were somewhat or very likely to buy smart guns. Though the NSSF spun those results as bad for smart guns, Mossberg sees an opportunity potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “I know lots of people who would love to get 14 percent of the firearms market,” he says. And new research shows the market could be much bigger. A nationally representative survey published by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in December found that nearly 60 percent of Americans, if they were to buy a new handgun, would be willing to purchase a smart gun.Police departments have also come around to the concept of issuing firearms that can’t be used by bad guys. More than 5 percent of officers killed in the line of duty are shot with their own weapons, often 9 mm handguns. In November, San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr told 60 Minutes that he wanted his officers to have the option to carry smart guns if they were available. More than a dozen law enforcement agencies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Florida have tested the iGun in recent months, according to Mossberg.Smart guns have also gained a powerful ally in Washington. In January, President Obama directed the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a strategy to promote smart gun research and expedite government procurement of the weapons.To bring a smart pistol to market, Mossberg says he needs to raise about $1 million for research and development—money that almost certainly won’t come from O.F. Mossberg & Sons or any other major firearms company. Following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway announced an effort to fund start-up companies dedicated to promoting gun safety. Conway’s Smart Tech Challenges Foundation gave Mossberg a grant of $100,000, which helped generate buzz for smart guns in the Valley. Yet nearly two years later, not a single venture capital firm has backed a smart-gun company. Margot Hirsch, the president of Smart Tech Challenges, says tech investors didn’t have smart guns on their radar in the past, but she hopes that now “the VC community and impact investors will be interested in investing, not only to make money, but to save lives.”Mossberg sees no reason why his product should be controversial. “In the 1700s and 1800s, there was still no manual safety device on a gun,” he observes, referring to the safety catches that are now ubiquitous on American handguns and rifles. “And then somebody put one on there and nobody cared. This is nothing more than that.”window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={""beacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""licenseKey"":""949ceaf672"",""applicationID"":""42428067"",""transactionName"":""MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMTD1VE"",""queueTime"":0,""applicationTime"":124,""atts"":""HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse"",""errorBeacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""agent"":""""}",1

In Orlando this afternoon, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with victims’ families and survivors of the massacre at the Pulse LGBT nightclub that claimed the lives of 49 people just days ago.Obama spoke about an increasingly urgent need for gun control legislation, saying “we need to work across political lines to do more to stop killers who want to terrorize us.”“The last two terrorist attacks on our soil—Orlando and San Bernardino—were homegrown,” he said. “Our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual…to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons…legally.”He insisted that the debate surrounding gun control needs to change, and called on the House and Senate to “rise to the moment and do the right thing” and pass legislation to curb access to weapons like the AR-15. “For so many [LGBT] people, the Pulse has been a safe haven…and on Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way possible,” Obama said. “Americans were targeted because we’re a country that’s learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.”Watch his remarks in full below:WATCH: President Obama’s full remarks after meeting with #Orlando shooting survivors and families of victims. https://t.co/qkyc0gPb3N	— ABC News (@ABC) June 16, 2016 ",1
82,"Yin Bogu/ZumaIt didn’t take long after the massacre in Orlando for the conversation to turn to gun control, especially considering the shooter allegedly used a weapon of war that he purchased legally just days before his attack on the gay nightclub.Is the worst mass shooting in history enough to finally move the needle on the gun control conversation? Time will tell. But an interesting perspective on the question comes via the team over at Google Trends, who have been crunching the search giant’s internal numbers on searches related to guns. Take a look how searches—represented on the maps below as ranked search terms within Google—have evolved over the last year, and even in the wake of the Orlando massacre.Here’s the 2015 average for the search terms “Gun control” and “Gun shop,” with each state colored by whichever term had a higher average search rank:You can see that “Gun shop” was the higher search term in most states in 2015, but that was starting to change in 2016. Take a look: But that’s changed in a big way since Orlando, where searches for “Gun control” dominate in every state except Kentucky:The “gun control” search term might have had a bounce post-Orlando since it’s a natural topic of conversation and one of the major news topics over the last few days and it is unclear whether a massacre of 49 mostly LGBTQ innocent people has inspired the population to take gun control more seriously. But maybe something is changing. Google Trends also looked at the same type of search traffic in the wake of other mass shootings, including after Oregon, Virginia, and Charleston. In those cases, search traffic for “Gun control” spiked only after Oregon: ",1
83,"In the wake of the worst mass shooting in US history, Jimmy Kimmel on Monday delivered a scathing monologue calling out congressional lawmakers who send their prayers instead of working for increased gun control measures. The Las Vegas native specifically called out President Trump and Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan for failing to act “because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.”“The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a number of other lawmakers who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip, also sent their thoughts and their prayers today—which is good,” Kimmel said.“They should be praying,” he continued. “They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country because it is so crazy.”Kimmel also showed the images of senators who just days after the Orlando shooting in June 2016 voted against a bill that would have closed certain gun sale loopholes. “These are the 56 senators who didn’t want to do anything about that,” he said.The powerful plea comes on the heels of similar emotional speeches from Kimmel over Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",1
84,"Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo at the March for Our Lives on March 24.David J. Phillip/APThe evening after a gunman killed 10 people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Houston police chief Art Acevedo took to Facebook to write an impassioned plea for gun control, writing that he had hit “rock bottom” after the massacre.“I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children,” Acevedo wrote in his post. “I know some have strong feelings about gun rights…I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue.”The Santa Fe High School shooting, 35 miles outside of Houston, is far from the first mass shooting to affect Texas cities in the past few years. Six months ago, 26 people were killed at the Texas First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. And in 2016, a gunman killed 5 police officers in Dallas. At least 99 people have died in 8 mass shootings in the state since 1984.Acevedo has called for stronger gun measures before, and on March 24 he joined in Houston’s March for Our Lives, one of many marches across the country spearheaded by teen survivors of the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.Here is his full Facebook post:To all my Facebook friends. Today I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children and a responding police officer who is clinging to life. I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve shed tears of sadness, pain and anger.I know some have strong feelings about gun rights but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue. Please do not post anything about guns aren’t the problem and there’s little we can do. My feelings won’t be hurt if you de-friend me and I hope yours won’t be if you decide to post about your views and I de-friend you.I have never accepted the status-quo in anything I do and I’ve never accepted defeat. And I won’t do it now. I will continue to speak up and will stand up for what my heart and my God commands me to do, and I assure you he hasn’t instructed me to believe that gun-rights are bestowed by him.The hatred being spewed in our country and the new norms we, so-called people of faith are accepting, is as much to blame for so much of the violence in our once pragmatic Nation.This isn’t a time for prayers, and study and Inaction, it’s a time for prayers, action and the asking of God’s forgiveness for our inaction (especially the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing).I close by saying, I wish those that move on from this page the best. May God Bless you and keep you.",1

Even as the National Rifle Association celebrates Donald Trump’s victory, gun control advocates have something to smile about today. Of the four gun-related measures on state ballots this year, three passed.The only gun-related ballot measure not to win, Question 3 asked voters whether background checks should be required for private gun sales. If neither the buyer nor the seller is a licensed gun dealer, they’d have to go to a licensed dealer who would run a background check. The measure would have also required a background check for loaning guns, with exceptions for gun transfers between family members, emergency self-defense, and temporary transfers for hunting and sport shooting. Supporters, including Maine Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense Fund and Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership Fund, have spent $5.2 million to get the measure passed. Approximately $1 million was spent against it, the vast majority by the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action.Prop 63 passed easily, garnering 63 percent of the vote. It will ban certain types of semi-automatic assault rifles, require background checks for ammunition sales, outlaw magazines that carry more than 10 bullets, create a system for confiscating guns from felons, and require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. Major components of the initiative already became law earlier this year, and gun rights groups say they will challenge the overlapping laws in court. Opponents spent nearly $1 million against the measure to the nearly $4.5 million spent by supporters.Similar to Maine’s ballot initiative, Question 1 will require most gun sales, including private sales, to be subject to a background check. However, it narrowly passed by less than 10,000 votes. The same exemptions that Maine allows also apply here. Supporters spent more than $18 million and received significant financial backing from Everytown For Gun Safety. The NRA Nevadans for Gun Freedom and Nevadans for State Gun Rights spent nearly $6.5 million to sink the initiative. The NRA stuck to its usual script in opposing the measure, writing, “Question 1 does nothing to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms.”Initiative 1491 allows family, household members, and police to petition a judge to temporarily prohibit a person’s access to guns if that person is found to be a risk to himself or others. Petitions for an “extreme risk protection order” will last one year. Those under order can request a hearing to argue against the order. The NRA opposed the measure, saying that “if a person is truly dangerous, existing law already provides a variety of mechanisms to deal with the individual.” Nonetheless, it passed with 71 percent of the vote.",1

On Monday, the Senate failed to move forward two gun control measures aimed at expanding background checks and blocking individuals listed on terrorist watch lists from obtaining weapons. This outcome was widely expected, even after a 15-hour marathon filibuster staged by Senate Democrats urging their fellow lawmakers to act on gun control in the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history.As Samantha Bee noted on the latest Full Frontal on Monday, Republicans including “rodent-faced soup sponge” Sen. Ted Cruz, have dismissed calls for increased gun control since the Orlando mass shooting as nothing more than a political game and political correctness staged by Democrats. Much of this, as Bee explained, is the result of the strong grip the National Rifle Association has on Republican lawmakers. Watch above as she slams the GOP, or as Bee calls the party “puppets of the NRA,” in the segment above.",1
87,"ABC NewsFive students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, made their way through all the major morning talks shows Sunday, appearing on NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and CNN. They announced nationwide marches for gun control next month and ripped politicians, including President Donald Trump, who benefit from the National Rifle Association’s political spending while refusing to act to strengthen gun laws.“Now is the time to get on the right side of this,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the students, said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “Because this is not something we are going to be let [you] sweep under the carpet.” Gonzalez said she was speaking directly to Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), and other lawmakers who have benefited from pro-gun money.“These people who are being funded by the NRA are not going to be allowed to remain in office when midterm elections roll around,” she said. “They are going to be voted out of office.”Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Alex Wind, and Jaclyn Corin are among the survivors of the shooting that killed 17 people at the high school on Wednesday. They drew praise from network and cable news hosts as they offered pointed advice for lawmakers and older Americans.On Sunday afternoon, the White House announced that Trump will hold what it called a listening session on gun violence with high school students this coming Wednesday. The White House did not say which students Trump would meet with or if he would speak with the students organizing the marches. Some Stoneman Douglas students and parents have said they don’t want to meet with Trump, the Daily Beast reported Friday.“We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” Kasky said on CNN’s State of the Union.“This is about us begging for our lives,” Kasky said. “This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about us creating a badge of shame for any politicians accepting money from the NRA and using us as collateral.”The students said they are planning are series of demonstrations called “March for Our Lives” that will take place around the country on March 24. It will include a rally in Washington. Other students are planning a nationwide school walkout on April  20—the 19th anniversary of the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado—to highlight lawmakers’ failure to address the problem.“We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks,” Gonzalez said during a speech at a rally on Saturday. “Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because…we are going to be the last mass shooting.”Other students from the school on Sunday criticized Trump for a tweet in which he blamed the the ongoing Russia probe for the FBI’s failure to act on warnings about the alleged gunman. Trump’s tweet drew widespread condemnation.",1
88,"Semi-automatic rifles line the walls of a gun shop in Lynnwood, Washington.Elaine Thompson/APThe day after a new poll revealed that 95 percent of American voters support universal background checks for gun purchases—a record high—a bi-partisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to improve the federal background check system.The measure would not mandate a background check for every gun sale. The “compromise” legislation, as the senators put it, would instead focus on requiring state and federal agencies to do a better job of entering criminal history records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), as is already required by law. The Fix NICS Act would penalize federal agencies that fail to properly input records and incentivize states to improve their overall reporting.The group of seven senators sponsoring the bill is led by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who has an A+ rating from the NRA, and includes four Republicans and three Democrats—Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), all prominent gun safety advocates.“It’s no secret that I believe much more needs to be done,” Sen. Murphy said in a statement on Thursday. “But this bill will make sure that thousands of dangerous people are prevented from buying guns. It represents the strongest update to the background checks system in a decade, and provides the foundation for more compromise in the future.”The bill was inspired by an apparent loophole that came to light in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at a baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 dead earlier this month. The shooter had a history of domestic abuse; as a member of the Air Force, he’d been court-martialed for two charges of domestic assault, sentenced to 12 months of confinement, and was kicked out of the military in 2014 with a Bad Conduct Discharge. Technically, his crimes prevented him from legally buying a gun, but the Air Force never submitted the criminal records for the the NICS database, allowing him to pass a background check and purchase a gun. It’s unclear how frequently this occurs, but the Trace found that it may be a much wider problem than this isolated incident.“Mass murderers in Sutherland Springs, Charleston, and Blacksburg were legally prohibited from accessing firearms, but gaps in NICS allowed each of them to walk out of a gun store with the weapons used to commit their crimes,” said Sen. Blumenthal. He told the New York Times, “It may seem to many like a baby step, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and this one could well be important in breaking the ice of complicity that has paralyzed Congress.”This isn’t the first time that lawmakers have introduced a law to force federal agencies to better comply with existing gun-control laws. In 2007, the House voted to close a loophole that allowed the Virginia Tech gunman to purchase weapons despite having been committed to a mental hospital. It provided grant money for states to update the background checks database, adding more criminal records and mental health information, and was similarly viewed as a compromise bill between lawmakers with opposing political views. A co-sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), said at the time, “This act will ensure that the background check system really is instant and accurate.” There has been improvement in reporting on both criminal backgrounds and mental health since then, but ten years and several mass shootings later shows there is still much to be done.",1
89,"Gerrymandering activists gather outside the Supreme Court in March. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via APThe Supreme Court dealt a big blow Monday to efforts to combat racial gerrymandering, approving Texas’ GOP-drawn political maps that had previously been found to discriminate intentionally against minority voters. In a 5-4 ruling, the court upheld the state’s congressional and legislative maps, with the exception of the map of one state legislative district, which the court struck down for reducing the voting power of minority groups. The court’s decision overturns the findings of the federal district court in Texas, which had found not only that the Legislature had discriminated against minorities in drawing certain districts, but also that the discrimination was an intentional effort to “ensure Anglo control.” But the court’s conservative majority disagreed, reversing the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination.Justice Sonia Sotomoyor issued a blistering dissent, joined by the other liberal justices. This decision “comes at serious costs to our democracy,” she wrote. “It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas—despite constituting a majority of the population within the State—will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.” The Texas case presented a quandary for the Supreme Court. In 2013, the court gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act, eliminating the ability of the federal government to block state and local election laws that discriminated against minorities. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the country had changed, and that the racism that had pervaded election practices since the civil rights movement had dissipated. Texas challenged that narrative. The state has lost nine racial discrimination voting cases since 2011, with multiple judges finding that the discrimination was intentional—including in the political maps at issue in this case.The court’s decision Monday is in keeping with its 2013 ruling. Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the majority “blinds itself to the overwhelming factual record…to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.”This latest battle over Texas’ political maps began shortly after the last redistricting period following the 2010 census. Texas’ population had ballooned over the previous decade due to the state’s rapidly expanding minority population, and nearly 90 percent of Texas’ 4.3 million new residents were Latino or African American. As the fastest-growing state, Texas received four new congressional districts. But when the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political maps the following year, it created four new districts that were largely controlled by white voters. Latino and African American rights groups sued over the new maps.A federal court blocked the 2011 maps and hastily put in place a tweaked version ahead of the 2012 elections for Congress and the state Legislature. These maps were intended to be temporary. But as soon as the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Texas Republicans simply passed these temporary maps as the state’s new permanent maps. Minority rights groups, including the Texas branch of the NAACP and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, challenged these maps, arguing that they retained the bias of the blocked 2011 maps they were based on. Last year, a district court in San Antonio agreed, finding in two separate rulings that the 2011 and 2013 maps intentionally discriminated by weakening the voting power of black and Latino voters.Conservative justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for the majority in Monday’s ruling. In upholding Texas’ maps, he found fault in the district court’s analysis. “Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State,” he wrote. “In redistricting cases, the ‘good faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.'”  The court’s ruling will allow the Republican-drawn maps to remain in place through the 2020 elections, until the next round of redistricting takes place following the census that year. But even then, it could shape the next decade’s maps: The court’s ruling will likely be seen as an open invitation for Republicans to continue to weaken the voting power of minority, Democratic-leaning voters in Texas and across the country. ",1

She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!— Donald J.

The latest involved White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday, when the owner of a Lexington, Virginia, restaurant asked her to leave over the Trump administration’s “inhumane” policies.Adding to the misrepresentations Monday, Trump also appeared to accuse House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of supporting Waters’ remarks moments after Pelosi did exactly the opposite.In the crucial months ahead, we must strive to make America beautiful again.

Rouda’s competitor, stem cell scientist Hans Kierstead, has conceded the second place spot in California’s “top-two” primary to Rouda, according to Rouda’s Twitter account.The concession comes after a weekslong, and yet still unfinished, vote count by the Orange County Registrar of Voters. In the days immediately following the election, Kierstead held a narrow lead over Rouda, a real estate investor. As OC workers slowly worked their way through the ballots, Rouda gained on, and eventually surpassed, Kierstead. As of Sunday, Rouda held a 126 vote lead over Kierstead.  I just got off the phone with @drhanskeirstead. We congratulated each other on a hard fought primary and he pledged his full support to our campaign to #flipthe48th and defeat @RepRohrabacher. #ThankYouHans— Harley Rouda (@HarleyRouda) June 25, 2018As in six other Republican-held districts across California, more residents of Rohrabacher’s south Orange County district supported Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Demographically, the district has a slight white majority, but about 40 percent of the its residents are either Latino or Asian. Its median annual household income is a healthy $89,000.Heading into the June 5 primary, many worried that California’s uncommon top-two “jungle primary”—where the top-two primary vote-getters, regardless of party, duke it out in the November general election—could conceivably have lead to Democrats getting locked out of the November general election.That didn’t happen. On June 6, Democrats let out a sigh of relief as it became clear they had avoided a lock-out in all the in-play districts. But in California’s 48th, the question of which Democrat would advance wasn’t clear until 19 days after the election.Though Rouda will likely tap broad Democratic financial support on his path to the November general election, his primary victory is basically the result a coin flip. The California State Democratic Party voted in February to endorse Keirstead, but the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) opted to spend money boosting Rouda in the days before the primary election.Incidentally, the DCCC also spent more than $100,000 boosting a lower polling Republican candidate John Gabbard, presumably to siphon votes away from another, stronger candidate Scott Baugh, to decrease the likelihood of Democrats getting shut out of the November general election, according to Open Secrets.In the primary, both Rouda and Keirstead ran on progressive platforms. If elected, Rouda has pledged to advocate for Medicare for all.",1
0,"The new president of the National Rifle Association, Oliver North, compared advocates of gun control to civil terrorists in an interview last week. The father of a 14-year-old girl killed in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in February has offered a powerful rebuttal.“We’re not criminal civil terrorists,” Fred Guttenberg told Newsweek in response to North’s remarks. “We’re people with a broken heart.”“The NRA and people like Oliver North, to them, it’s a job,” Guttenberg said as he discussed the gun control debate spurred by the shooting. “They could retire and go on with their life. I can’t, because my daughter isn’t here.”Guttenberg’s daughter, Jaime, was among the 17 people killed in the February massacre.North, named the NRA’s new president last Monday, told the conservative newspaper The Washington Times that the gun group had become the victim of “civil terrorism.” Advocates for stricter gun control had launched a “cyberwar” against the NRA, he said, and threatened the group’s members. He gave the example of a protester charged with a misdemeanor after she sprayed fake blood on the home of an NRA lobbyist.“They call them activists. That’s what they’re calling themselves. They’re not activists — this is civil terrorism. This is the kind of thing that’s never been seen against a civil rights organization in America,” North told the Times. “You go back to the terrible days of Jim Crow and those kinds of things — even there you didn’t have this kind of thing. We didn’t have the cyberwar kind of thing that we’ve got today.”North ― a retired lieutenant colonel known for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s ― added that he did not believe that the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in which 17 people died had “fundamentally changed” the national gun debate. And he said the young survivors of the shooting, some of whom have emerged as leaders of the recent national movement against gun violence, had been “swept up by a broader propaganda machine.”“What they did very successfully with a frontal assault, and now intimidation and harassment and lawbreaking, is they confused the American people,” he said of the activists.North has been widely criticized for his comments. Stoneman Douglas students Lauren Hoggs and Cameron Kasky used Twitter posts to lambast North and the NRA. Guttenberg also posted on the social media platform to challenge the NRA president.“My daughter was murdered by an AR 15 … so I do not care what you think of me,” Guttenberg said in a series of messages.",1
1,"Last weekend the National Rifle Association held its 147th annual convention, which was attended by a record 87,000 people. HuffPost sent reporter Melissa Jeltsen to cover it. We asked her to report on the current concerns of gun owners, especially in the wake of horrific mass shootings like those in Parkland, Florida; Sutherland Springs, Texas; and Las Vegas and the rise of an emboldened gun control movement. Jeltsen was met with hostility and a general belief that the media were fueling the flames of “fake news.” She wrote about the protesters she encountered and how the NRA appears to be readying itself to battle in the upcoming midterm elections. Below is a Q & A about her experience at the convention. What was the vibe like?It was a really interesting moment in time to observe the NRA’s annual convention. For months, the group has been under attack by gun control advocates, the most vocal of whom are the grieving Parkland teenagers. These kids watched their best friends die, and they’re angry. They don’t care about being polite or gentle, and they’ve named and shamed the NRA as enemy No. 1. As a result, the convention, which boasted record attendance, had a real atmosphere of defiance. Many people told me they wanted to send a message of support for the embattled organization. I encountered many attendees who were at their first convention and met others who had signed up for a lifetime membership while there. On my first full day, I sat in a packed arena to hear Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump speak. (To start with, I had to fight to attend the event. Even though I was fully credentialed, an NRA staff member said she wasn’t sure if I was allowed into the arena after seeing my HuffPost badge. About 15 minutes later, after calling her boss, they let me in.)  While we waited for the president, we watched videos produced by NRATV, the organization’s news outlet. Most of the videos were about the “lying” mainstream media, as NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch put it. In one, a man stood next to a TV as it played news segments. Then he smashed it to bits with a sledgehammer. The audience in the arena went wild. Another video sent a message to the media: “What makes you think anyone wants to hear your elitist, uninformed opinions?”The audience laughed rapturously and clapped. During Pence’s address, he called out the media for not “telling the whole story about firearms in America.” He complained that the media focus too much “on the tragedies and the heartbreak” and ignore what happens “when well-trained, law-abiding gun owners save lives.” I heard this point repeated over and over by NRA members during the convention: The media purposely misrepresent the reality of gun ownership in the U.S. by focusing on fringe cases.  Why do you think NRA members were so hostile about the media?The NRA’s animosity toward the press is nothing new. But it does appear that the rhetoric has ratcheted up in the past few months. Remember Loesch’s claim that many in the media love mass shootings? My sense was that right now, gun enthusiasts feel they are personally under attack. It is not politically correct to go after their most visible opponents, the Parkland students. So instead, they’ve set their sights on the press, which they feel is responsible for creating a false perception of momentum around gun control efforts. After Pence and Trump’s speeches, I felt a little uncomfortable walking around the convention center with a HuffPost media badge on my chest. Each time I asked people if I could interview them, it elicited comments about the dishonest media. I engaged in multiple conversations where I explained how important accurate and fair reporting was to me. I attended three informational sessions. In each one, someone brought up the “fake news” media. A few people refused to talk to me because of where I worked. On my last day, I was standing in line to try out a virtual reality shooting game. I asked an older man in front of me if I could ask him some questions, and he agreed. I shook his hand and introduced myself as a reporter from HuffPost. “HuffPost?” he replied. “Then no.” He turned his back on me, and we remained like that in line together for the next 20 minutes.  Later that day, I was kicked out of a “school security” seminar after a panelist noticed that I was audio-recording the session on my cellphone and pointed at me. To be fair to him, the event was originally billed as closed to the press, but an NRA staff member had given me permission to attend. A security guard was called, and I was asked to pack up my stuff and leave the room.What was most surprising about conventiongoers?I was quite taken aback by the fact that almost everyone I talked to denied that the gun control movement was having a moment. I thought it was an indisputable fact that we could all agree on. In the past few months, we’ve seen massive protests, student walkouts, lots of state-level legislative change. But many people told me that the “fake news” media had created an anti-gun narrative and it didn’t reflect what was happening on the ground.What was most challenging about reporting from the convention?I had a few goals going into the convention. First, I wanted to understand why members supported an organization that resists virtually every effort to tighten existing gun laws or to pass new gun control measures. If you’re a responsible gun owner who follows the rules, why wouldn’t you want to see the background check system expanded? But, for the most part, I struggled to find anyone to interview who didn’t simply repeat hollow slogans like “Gun don’t kill people, people kill people.” I think many people were reticent to talk to me and so stuck to talking points. It meant I didn’t learn as much as I wanted to. Second, I wanted to hear NRA members grapple with those on the other side of the debate. Many people who are working for changes to the country’s gun laws are motivated by a personal experience with gun violence. They were shot or lost a family member. They are acting out of a sense of duty, hoping to protect others from going through the pain and tragedy they did. When I would ask NRA members about the people working to pass gun control, such as the Parkland teens, they’d essentially say, “Yeah, it sucks, but it’s not the gun’s fault. Tragedies are bad, but guns aren’t the problem.”Talk about the protesters. What were they protesting?For me, the most poignant moment of the convention happened on Saturday, when a father of one of the Parkland teens painted a protest mural. Here you had this grieving father, standing in front of protesters and creating a piece of art in memory of his son, who died less than three months ago.People cried as they watched him. It was a reminder of the real, devastating impact of gun violence ― something that was rarely discussed inside the convention walls. There were two rallies over the weekend, which drew students and teachers and other concerned citizens. But the number of protesters were dwarfed by NRA supporters. On Friday night I followed a small group of protesters as they marched around the outside the convention center, chanting, “Hey, hey, NRA, how many kids did you kill today?” At one point, a pickup truck drove by. The driver slowed down, and then someone held up an NRA swag bag in the open window. They wanted the protesters to know they weren’t with them.",1
2,"Pennsylvania is creating a new gun violence prevention initiative that will fund programs working to stop shootings in urban communities, where this bloodshed tends to take the largest toll, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced on Tuesday. At a press event in Philadelphia, Wolf unveiled the $1.5 million Gun Violence Reduction Initiative, which will direct grant money to municipalities seeking to implement violence prevention strategies that have helped make neighborhoods a bit more peaceful. The state opened the application process on Tuesday and will begin awarding grants in July.In early March, Wolf and state Rep. Jordan Harris (D), who chairs the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus, held a listening session with constituents in Philadelphia, where they met with gun violence victims to discuss the problem of daily shootings. Wolf said the event made it clear that the state must invest further in interventions that appear to have produced results in other cities.“After hearing from this community about the real-world dangers of gun violence, I’m proud to return and deliver funds to help stem the tide of violence,” the governor said in a statement.Wolf called the grants an “important step toward achieving that goal,” and he has said his administration will continue to show a commitment to combating violence.With the launch of the Gun Violence Reduction Initiative, Pennsylvania becomes just the seventh state to directly fund violence prevention and intervention programs for urban areas.High-profile mass shootings in affluent, predominantly white communities often dominate the conversation and policy agenda around gun violence. But day-to-day interpersonal violence in cities accounts for the majority of the 13,000 firearm homicides and 60,000 nonfatal shootings that take place across the nation each year.Those trends are apparent in Pennsylvania, where in 2016 around half of the state’s gun violence incidents took place in Philadelphia County, Harris told HuffPost.Harris said that with all the attention and resources dedicated treating the opioid epidemic as a public health problem, the government should be willing to take a similar approach to gun violence. He called it “public enemy number one” in the communities he represents.“When are folks going to see all the black bodies and Hispanic bodies that are dying in the streets of Philadelphia? When are we going to see them as part of the epidemic as well?” he asked.When people separate the issue of mass shootings from broader discussions of gun violence, it can make it hard to communicate the scope of the problem, Harris added. “We seem to think one is more important than the other, but the mother who lost her son when he got shot on the corner on her block, she doesn’t feel any less pain than the parent of a kid who was killed in a school,” he said. “There’s no less pain, no less heartache, no less grief.”California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York have made similar investments in these programs. A number of cities and communities that run these violence prevention efforts have seen substantial declines in shootings and violent crime, according to a recent report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national nonprofit founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).Last month, Maryland became the sixth state to take this approach, with the passage of a law that sets aside $5 million over the next year to fund grants to bolster these strategies.Gun violence prevention and intervention programs tend to follow a few popular models. Some work directly in the community, mediating conflicts and providing outreach and social services to individuals most at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of violence. Others are based out of hospitals and work to provide continuing care to victims to disrupt cycles of violence.A number of organizations are already doing this sort of work in Philadelphia, often without recognition or the funding they need to be as effective as they can be, said Harris. The Gun Violence Reduction Initiative will free up some resources to help them succeed, he added.With gun violence costing states hundreds of millions of dollars each year in health care and criminal justice expenses alone, advocates say spending money on prevention actually ends up saving taxpayers money.“It sounds like this is just a start and I’m hoping that the program will continue to grow,” said Mike McLively, the director of the Urban Gun Violence Initiative at Giffords.McLively went on to urge gun violence prevention activists in states that aren’t currently funding these programs to reach out to their governors.“Governors and executives can take the lead in a state and set the agenda and at least create a framework,” he said.",1
3,"We are Republican, Democratic and independent. We come from the East, South, Midwest and West. We are conservative, progressive and liberal. We are men and women. We include eight members of the Circle of Chiefs, the highest conservation honor of the Outdoor Writers Association of America. We are all different in many ways, but we have important commonalities. We are Americans; we are gun owners; we are hunters; and we support responsible firearm regulation. Yes, the Second Amendment conveys a right to “keep and bear” firearms. But rights come with responsibilities, and we all have a moral responsibility to address America’s crisis of gun violence.We avoid the term ”common sense,” understanding the wisdom in Voltaire’s words ― “Common sense is not so common.”Perhaps nature’s unpredictability, or the predictability that either our abilities or our equipment will fail at the most inopportune moment, have conditioned us to find solace in simplicity. We believe simple and responsible steps can and must be taken to end the cycle of gun violence and tragedy to which we are all witness in today’s America.We are at a turning point. There are now 265 million guns in private ownership — more than at any time in our nation’s history, and owned by a smaller proportion of the population than ever. Only about 30 percent of Americans own guns, and about 60 percent live in gun-free households. The long-term trend away from gun ownership will continue. As people who own and use guns respectfully, we feel an urgency to speak up for a simple, sensible approach.Hunters and hunting are also declining. In 1955, 10 percent of Americans hunted. Today, it’s less than 5 percent. But the positive image of the hunter as a skilled and conscientious “sportsman” is being abused in defense of an out-of-control gun culture. Most hunters own guns principally to hunt game. We use them safely and respectfully: If someone is injured during their use, it will most likely be a friend or family member, since that is who we hunt with. We don’t buy a lot of guns. We usually have a few favorites, often passed down to us by fathers or grandfathers. The gun industry figured that out decades ago, and switched to creating guns for a different market.That’s not to say that all hunters are like-minded on the issue of regulating firearms. As our numbers have dwindled, many have found a comforting alliance with Second Amendment radicalism. But we believe this is not representative of most hunters, and certainly not the tradition of the hunter-sportsman. We do not need AR-15s or any assault-style weapon to hunt game. That’s not to say some people won’t use them to hunt. But they are simply not necessary, and are actually not preferable for legitimate, fair-chase hunting.We believe that simple, responsible reforms in firearm policy are an urgent necessity. Hunting and hunters should not be seen, or used, as a shield against constructive bipartisan solutions. We see the need and opportunity to frame compromise between the Second Amendment’s right to keep and bear arms and the Fifth Amendment’s right to life and liberty.Here’s where we would begin:1. An age minimum of 21 years to purchase any gun;2. Anyone on the Terrorist Screening Center’s “no-fly list” may not purchase or possess firearms;3. Anyone on Social Security disability due to mental illness may not purchase or possess firearms;4. Prohibit new sales of semiautomatic assault or tactical-style weapons;5. Prohibit new sales of semiautomatic shotguns or rifles (except .22-caliber rim fire) that can hold more than 10 rounds;6. Prohibit any accessory designed or mechanical modification intended a) to increase the rate at which any firearm may be discharged; or b) to increase the magazine capacity of a semiautomatic rifle beyond 10 rounds (except .22-caliber rim fire);7. Mandatory and universal background checks for all firearm sales;8. Prohibit sales of firearms except through registered/licensed dealers (no direct private sales);9. Enact gun violence restraining order authorities allowing courts to temporarily prohibit a person from purchasing or possessing firearms when a family member, community welfare expert or law enforcement officer presents evidence of a threat; and10. Repeal the “Dickey ban” on scientific research in the area of gun violence and implement the Institute of Medicine’s 2013 gun violence research agenda. These suggestions are simple to implement and enforce. They do limit the rights of honest and law-abiding citizens, but they are responsible limitations that do not infringe the ability of Americans to hunt, shoot, or protect themselves and their families. And in comparison to the 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who have been stripped of all of their rights, and of life and liberty, it is a small price to pay. There are simple, responsible solutions. No one should use hunters and hunting as an excuse to avoid pursuing them.Daniel M.

4,"DALLAS ― John Lott, the National Rifle Association’s favorite academic and gun researcher, had a question for the mostly older, white, male crowd seated in front of him.How many of them had heard someone say that federal gun research has been stymied for years because of Congress? Or that the U.S. has a uniquely high rate of gun homicide compared to other nations? Or that guns make suicide easier?All those claims were lies, he said, told by gun control advocates and repeated by an unquestioning media intent on pushing an anti-gun agenda.Over the weekend the NRA held its 147th annual convention, and Lott, whose highly discredited book More Guns, Less Crime, is considered the bible of the gun lobby, addressed a packed room inside the Kay Hutchison Convention Center here in downtown Dallas. For three days, gun rights enthusiasts gathered to peruse the newest firearms and gear, attend educational seminars such as “Refuse to be a victim: Crime prevention strategies,” and “14 factors impacting your shooting performance under duress,” and to simply have fun.Many were also there to send a pointed political message: NRA, we support you.The NRA is now on the defense as it faces off against a country that is mostly fed up with current gun control laws that did not prevent horrific mass shootings like those that took place in Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and most recently in Parkland, Florida.Since February, the U.S. has witnessed nationwide protests, student walkouts and countless state legislative wins. This coming November, advocates promise to vote out politicians who take money from the NRA, which opposes virtually every state and federal effort to tighten existing gun laws or pass any new gun safety measures.At the convention, many attendees disputed the idea that gun control is gaining momentum. Instead, they said it was a false narrative created by the media. Fake news, in other words. Many participants told HuffPost that journalists ignore positive stories about guns, such as home invasions thwarted by gun owners. They said the media spends a disproportionate amount of time covering gun violence.“It’s what the press chooses to cover,” said Brian Lilly, 49, who attended the convention for the first time this year, alongside his father and his 18-year-old son, Benjamin. “They are censoring what the true pulse of the citizenry thinks.”When his son, a high school senior, was asked what he thought about his fellow students who were advocating for gun control, he exhaled sharply.“I think they want to get out of class,” he said. “It’s what’s on the news. They can’t back up their claims. They don’t know what they’re talking about.” The biggest misperception about guns is that “they’re always used for bad things and they’re not used for good,” he said.Dante Martin, 52, agreed. He stood at the Beretta booth, testing out a semi-automatic handgun he was looking to potentially acquire for his wife. It was his first convention despite being an NRA member for a decade. This year, he brought his 15-year-old son as a reward for getting good grades.“Guns don’t kill people ― people kill people,” Martin said. “Everyone has sympathy for people who were killed in these horrific events, but how many people are killed by drunk drivers? Where’s the outrage there?”He, like others interviewed, said that if guns were removed, perpetrators would just use vehicles to commit mass murder. “Without your second amendment rights, all the other [amendments] are just suggestions,” he added.Inside the sprawling exhibit hall, giant photos of NRA leaders bore down on members as they pointed and pulled the triggers of unloaded firearms, the sound of metallic clicks filling the air. There was a tone of jubilance and celebration.A poster with a silhouette of a woman carrying a grocery bag in the dark asked ominously if she was “trained for what’s around the next corner.” Dozens of people lined up to try a virtual reality simulator to test their firearm skills in a self-defense scenario. As people examined firearms on the floor, it was common to see them pointed directly at passersby.  Outside the convention, cars decked out with enlarged photos of victims of gun violence circled the center, weaving between an endless stream of convention-goers as they crossed the street. Protesters gathered on Friday and Saturday to rally against the gun group but were greatly outnumbered by the more than 87,000 people who attended the NRA event, which set a new record. The site of the convention was notable for its proximity to two historic acts of violence. It is blocks from where Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy, using a mail-order rifle he bought from an ad in the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine, and the location of a police ambush in 2016 in which five police officers were killed.Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was fatally shot at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, implored President Donald Trump to listen to survivors as he painted a mural on Saturday, in front of hundreds of protesters.  “I’m impressed with the support that the NRA got from our president yesterday,” Oliver said, his voice strained. “I haven’t heard from President Trump the name of my son, not even once.”Speaking in front of the NRA on Friday, Trump appeared comfortable and happy, buoyed by the enthusiasm of the crowd who laughed uproariously at his jokes. In a typically meandering speech, he made fun of John Kerry for breaking his leg and thanked rap artist Kanye West for boosting his poll numbers among black Americans. He also mimicked the mass shooting at the Bataclan theater in Paris using finger guns. No one laughed at that.He urged NRA members to get out and vote in November.“We cannot get complacent,” he said. “We have to win the midterms.” Attendees said they were not fazed by Trump’s inconsistencies on gun rights. After the Parkland shooting, he suggested that firearms should be immediately confiscated from people deemed dangerous, raising alarms among gun rights proponents. “I think he’s in our corner,” said Mr. Nichols, a retired military member from San Antonio who only gave his last name. “I tend to look at his actions, not always what he says.”“The only thing I wish he would do is stop tweeting,” said a 52-year-old Texas man who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Donald. “Shut up and get offline.”Donald said he was a “lifetime member” of the NRA, a level of membership which costs $1,500 and does not ever need to be renewed. He was at the convention with his wife and son. All three work in their family-owned barbecue restaurant, which has been broken into five times. They keep a gun on site for protection. His son become a lifetime NRA member earlier that day. The NRA are “on the front lines, fighting for our rights,” Donald said. “Individually, I don’t feel like I have any power, but as part of a group I do.”",1
5,"Tens of thousands of National Rifle Association members descended on Dallas this week for the gun advocacy group’s 147th annual meeting ― once again with an assist from President Donald Trump. Ahead of the event, which ran from Thursday to Sunday, the NRA said that 80,000 members would be attending and billed it as the largest in the organization’s history. But outside the convention center, another crowd assembled to protest the NRA’s efforts to stifle gun control laws.In the year since the last meeting, the U.S. had its deadliest mass shooting in recent history when a gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds in Las Vegas. And it saw a powerful uprising of young gun control advocates after a shooter gunned down 17 students and faculty members at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The meeting was also a chance for commerce, with vendors taking orders for firearms, and it gave Trump a chance to address the crowd for the fourth year in a row. This year, people lined up hours early to get into the arena where he regurgitated many of his favorite pro-gun talking points.Take a look at photos from the annual event below:Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that vendors take orders for gun purchases at the NRA convention; those orders are finalized via customers’ local gun dealers.",1
6,"DALLAS ― The father of a student slain in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting challenged President Donald Trump to visit his home and see his dead son’s bedroom. “I haven’t heard from President Trump the name of my son, not even once,” said Manuel Oliver, speaking during a student-led rally outside City Hall in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday morning. Hundreds of activists and students gathered to protest the National Rifle Association, which is holding its annual meeting nearby. “It takes one second ― ‘Joaquin Oliver’ ― and you are not able to mention that name,” he said, addressing Trump directly. “It is important, your support, because you could make things happen along with us. Let me rephrase that: You could make it happen faster, because we are going to make it happen.”Oliver’s son, Joaquin, was fatally shot alongside 16 other people during the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The survivors of that tragedy, one of the deadliest school shootings in modern U.S. history, have now emerged as leaders of a freshly invigorated national gun control movement, which has set its sights on the NRA.Oliver live-painted a protest mural in honor of his son, between speeches by gun control activists and students. At the end, he walked onto the stage with a hammer. “Let’s feel how it feels to be in a school hall and listen to something like this,” he said, before loudly smashing holes in 17 stick figures illustrated on the giant canvas. He then stuck a sunflower through each one.  Just a block away from the protest, thousands of members of the country’s most powerful gun group strolled inside the Kay Hutchison Convention Center, shopping the NRA store, taking seminars and perusing “15 acres of guns and gear” inside the exhibit hall.The annual convention, now in its 147th year, comes at a particularly tense moment for the NRA. This year’s theme is “a show of strength,” and the NRA appears to be in a defensive posture. In a speech on Friday, the group’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, urged members not to be ashamed. “What they really want is for you to be afraid to publicly associate with this organization,” he said. “They don’t want you wearing an NRA hat or putting an NRA sticker on your car or truck.” He encouraged attendees to stand tall and “stand proud.”Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke to members on Friday inside a packed area. Both leaders advocated arming teachers and increasing security in schools to protect children. Outside City Hall, Rosie Wallace, 29, and Kenna Edwards, 25, said they came to the protest because they want to see fewer school shootings and more common-sense gun reform.They both admired Oliver’s mural. “It’s really moving that someone would be so expressive about losing their child and willing to sacrifice their time to make a change for something they believe in,” said Wallace, an environmental scientist for the Environmental Protection Agency. Edwards, who works at a software company, said she was disappointed in Dallas for allowing the NRA convention to be held there.“It’s on-brand for Dallas, but as a resident, I don’t like it,” she said. Julia Heilrayne, an Austin, Texas, high school student, attended the protest with a red target printed on her forehead. She spoke with HuffPost at a smaller protest in front of City Hall the night before. Since the Parkland shooting, she said, students at her school are skittish if they hear a loud noise, like a chip bag popping in the cafeteria.  “You can drop a textbook in the hallway, and everyone freezes,” she said. Heilrayne said she got involved in the gun control movement after a friend of hers ― a third-grader ― was shot and killed in 2017. “I had to fight for her,” she said. “I had to be her voice, because she doesn’t have one any more.”After the gun control protest wrapped up, a group of counterprotesters gathered nearby openly carrying firearms.Lawrence Solem, 40, a machinery mechanic from Lewisville, Texas, said he wanted to show his support for the right to carry.“Evil can and always will exist in the world,” he said. “Evil doesn’t care about time or location. That’s why it’s safest to carry at all times.”",1
7,"Fox News anchor Shepard Smith sharply criticized President Donald Trump on Friday for headlining the National Rifle Association convention mere months after he vowed to take action on gun control in the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people died.Just after that shooting, Trump had taunted lawmakers for failing to act on gun control, claiming in a televised roundtable discussion that they were “afraid” of the NRA. He talked about raising the age for legal purchases of assault-style AR-15s from 18 to 21, banning bump stocks boosting the firepower of AR-15s, and tightening up background checks on gun buyers.Instead, Smith observed, Trump went to Dallas to headline for the powerful national gun lobbying group’s meeting, where he “falsely stated that Democrats want all guns outlawed.”   While Trump and the NRA are now pushing to arm teachers in schools, the NRA’s Leadership Forum itself was, ironically, a “gun-free zone” to protect Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.Smith also noted Trump and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s reversals on the Stormy Daniels payment saga. Giuliani revealed Wednesday that Trump had reimbursed his attorney Michael Cohen’s $130,000 payment to Daniels, the adult film star who alleges she had an affair with Trump.Trump appeared to support Giuliani in a tweet on Thursday, but then insisted Friday that his new attorney needed to get his facts straight.“Maybe they’re just trying to confuse everybody,” said Smith. “What team Trump said last month, then changed last week, then re-imagined again on Tuesday was revised and extended again” on Friday, he said. “And space under the bus is now at a premium. Rudy Giuliani found himself wedged there today.” Giuliani issued a statement Friday nearly as tortured as the Trump team’s Daniels story: “My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the president’s knowledge but instead my understanding of these matters.” “Now let this one sink in just in case this version lasts more than a few hours,” Smith quipped.Watch Smith’s remarks in the video at the top of this story.",1
8,"In his address at the National Rifle Association’s annual Dallas convention Friday, President Donald Trump swerved to thank Kanye West for supposedly doubling his African-American poll numbers before getting right to the point: “Let’s talk about guns, shall we?” The president then proceeded to dole out some questionable information on guns, gun control and people who carry guns.Here are the highlights. The statistic Trump cited comes from the Crime Prevention Research Center, which claims that, in a span of more than six decades, 98 percent of mass shootings occurred in “gun-free zones.” Take it with a big grain of salt: The study was authored by John Lott, a gun rights advocate and author of a recent controversial New York Times op-ed on background checks. The meaning of the statistic heavily depends on how both “mass shooting” and “gun-free zone” are defined.An official definition of “mass shooting” doesn’t exist, and there’s a lot of debate over which incidents count and which don’t. The FBI stipulates that three or more people must be killed for the term to apply, but Lott defined it as four or more deaths in public. By doing so, he discounted private residences where domestic violence-related shootings have occurred. He also did not count shootings that were “part of another crime,” such as a robbery. There’s also no official way to define “gun-free zone,” which may apply to places where civilians can’t carry firearms but officials can. The way Lott chose to define it in his research is questionable; for example, he considered military sites like Fort Hood to be ‘gun-free zones,’ even though guns are clearly present there.That gun-carrying civilians lead to crime prevention is an old NRA talking point: A good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. Experts strongly dispute this idea. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded in 2005 that “no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data.”PolitiFact deemed the statistic Trump cited Friday only “half-true.”“There is no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares that this school is a gun-free zone,” Trump said at the convention, repeating his proposal to arm some teachers and school security guards.HuffPost’s Rebecca Klein spoke to teachers and law enforcement officials about Trump’s idea and found many of them were against it, including the national teachers unions. Many worried that such a policy would do more harm than good and lead to a lot of students being injured by accident at school. “Anyone who hasn’t received the extensive training provided to law enforcement officers will likely be mentally unprepared to take a life, especially the life of a student assailant,” Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association for School Resource Officers, said in a statement. “We all know what’s going on in Chicago, but Chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country,” Trump said Friday.Trump and others in the pro-gun crowd have long held up crime rates in Chicago as evidence that gun control doesn’t work. Although both Illinois and its largest city do have strong gun laws, Chicago is a short drive from both Wisconsin and Indiana, where laws are significantly weaker. Studies have found that most of the guns used in crimes in Chicago come from out of state, with many coming from much farther away.Beyond that, Trump’s comments ignore the fact that homicides and shootings in Chicago have actually been on the decline for more than a year. In 2017, Chicago had the ninth-highest homicide rate of any U.S. city.“Paris, France, has the toughest gun laws in the world,” said Trump, going on to explain how a small group of terrorists armed with AK-47s “brutally killed” more than 130 people in the French capital in 2015.“If one employee or just one patron had a gun … the terrorists would have fled or been shot, and it would’ve been a whole different story.”This is another of Trump’s favorite talking points, which he’s been using since the November 2015 Bataclan massacre.Putting aside for a second the absolute chaos that might have ensued if an arena full of armed concertgoers had decided to open fire on their assailants in the pitch dark, Trump is also leaving out some broader context. With its strong gun laws, the overall firearm death rate in France is about one-quarter of what it is in the U.S. Although violent crime is not unheard of in Paris, the city experiences just a fraction of the homicides that an American city of a comparable population does. Gun homicides also appear to be primarily an issue among rival criminal gangs.“I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle, is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,” said Trump. “Yes, that’s right, they don’t have guns, they have knives, and instead there’s blood all over the floors of this hospital.”We’re not really sure what Trump’s point is here. If he’s noting that all violence is not gun violence, then sure. But the fact that Londoners are making it to hospitals to receive care is significant. Knives tend to be less lethal than guns, and it’s far easier to injure or kill larger numbers of people, often indiscriminately or unintentionally, by shooting than it is by stabbing.A recent study in the U.S. found that more gunshot victims are dying before reaching the emergency room than they were a decade ago, even as trauma care has improved. One theory for this trend is an increasing “intensity” of violence, suggesting people may be getting shot more times, at closer range, with higher-caliber rounds, or simply while farther from the nearest hospital.There’s no saying how much worse the problem would be in London if it were as easy to get a gun there as it is in the U.S.",1
10,"Harley-Davidson Inc. announced it is shifting production of some of its motorcycles to Europe because of President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war, which critics warn could hamstring the humming U.S. economy and cost jobs.Trump hosted executives from the Milwaukee-based company and the union officials representing its workers last year at the White House. The president hailed the company as a model of American manufacturing, an industry he promised to restore. He further praised the executives “for building things in America” and predicted the company would expand its operations during his administration.Things aren’t looking so great for the iconic motorcycle producer this year, however. The company said in a regulatory filing on Monday that retaliatory tariffs imposed on American exports by the European Union rose between 6 percent and 31 percent this year, resulting in a jump in $2,200 per average motorcycle exported to the EU.But rather than hike prices in the U.S., the company said it would absorb the cost in the short term ― projected to be some $30 million to $45 million through this year― and shift some production to international factories in coming months.“Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company’s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. Europe is a critical market for Harley-Davidson,” the company said in a statement.The move follows a round of layoffs at the company’s manufacturing plants in Milwaukee and Kansas City, Missouri, last year, costing 180 manufacturing jobs.Trump tweeted Monday that he was “surprised” by Harley-Davidson’s decision to move some production overseas, urging the company to be “patient.”Trump on Friday further threatened to escalate a trade war with Europe by imposing a 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports of EU-assembled cars.Republican leaders in Congress have so far resisted challenging Trump on trade, worrying that an intraparty clash could harm the party in November’s midterm elections. But there are signs that some members of the president’s party ― which historically has favored free trade ― may finally be reaching a breaking point. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), for example, warned over the weekend that he’s prepared to oppose Trump’s judicial nominees unless the Senate votes on legislation curtailing the president’s power to unilaterally impose tariffs on other countries.“I think myself and a number of senators, at least a few of us, will stand up and say, ‘Let’s not move any more judges until we get a vote, for example, on tariffs,’” Flake, who is retiring this year, said on ABC’s “This Week.”This story has been updated with Trump’s Monday tweet.",1
11,"CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta was heckled at President Donald Trump’s rally in South Carolina on Monday as members of the crowd chanted “Go home!” and “CNN sucks!”Acosta was reportedly waiting in the press area at the rally in West Columbia, where the president was about to campaign for the state’s Republican Gov. Henry McMaster. But before Trump arrived, attendees holding signs reading “CNN fake news” began chanting for the reporter to leave the venue. At one point, a woman pointed at the journalist, repeating “Take him out” and urging her fellow rally-goers to heckle him.Acosta attempted to shake the woman’s hand, telling her he had a right to cover the event. He then said that he respected the United States as the woman waved her arms at him.“No! You do not respect it,” the woman yelled.Acosta later addressed the event on CNN.“While we have had people come up to us and be nice, I did have an elderly woman come up to me just a short while ago,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “She came up to me and said that we at CNN should get the ‘f’ out of this auditorium. She then turned to the crowd and whipped them up into a frenzy.”He continued: “We are here to do our jobs and report the news and report on this rally, and we’re not going anywhere.”Later in the evening, Trump began his speech on a familiar note, attacking the press and calling media outlets gathered at the rally “fake news,” a taunt that drew raucous boos and jeers. “The enemy, the enemy of the people I call ’em,” the president said of the media.Despite his continued attacks on CNN, he appeared to set his sights on a new target following an exchange of barbs with late-night host Jimmy Fallon this week. “NBC is worse actually than CNN,” Trump quipped.Acosta has often earned the ire of the president and other White House officials, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, over the past year. Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, recently called for the journalist’s press credentials to be suspended after Acosta shouted questions at Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a summit in Singapore earlier this month.“Dear Brad.. dictatorships take away press credentials,” Acosta fired back on Twitter. “Not democracies.”",1

13,"An Oregon National Guardsman is facing disciplinary action after suggesting that undocumented immigrants are “lucky we aren’t executing them.”Private First Class Gerod Martin wrote the offensive comment Wednesday on a Facebook page to raise funds for the Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.“Waste of money,” Martin, 21, wrote in a comment that has since been deleted. “They’re lucky we aren’t executing them.”Martin’s Facebook account appears to have been deleted as well, or has been set to private. Screenshots of Martin’s page show him wearing his Oregon National Guard uniform in his profile picture. “Just a young buck serving his country,” he wrote on the page.Martin’s comments violated the uniform code of military justice, Maj.

He said the organization will hold Martin accountable for his actions but hasn’t decided on a punishment yet.“This was a clear violation in uniform to say anything like that, or anything political because we enforce the policies of our politicians,” Bomar said. “That was just a horrific comment.”The Oregon National Guard has strict rules on social media conduct, Bomar added.“One of our policies is to conduct yourself as though you’re a servicemember 24/7,” he said. “Even if you are working a civilian job, you are still part of our team and need to remember to have those values wherever you go.”HuffPost was unable to reach Martin for comment.The viral Facebook fundraiser to help immigrant families, which a couple in California created last week in response to the Trump administration’s highly controversial family separation policy, has raised over $20 million.Backlash over the policy prompted President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to end family separation at the border by detaining children and parents together.",1
14,"Netflix adds a movie you’ve likely already seen this week. And if you haven’t seen it, now is your chance to finally catch up with the American zeitgeist.“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” joins on June 26. The movie earned well over $1 billion at the box office and only debuted in theaters last December. It’s fairly rare that Netflix adds such a recently popular movie, so this is a particularly noteworthy addition.If you’ve already seen the movie or simply aren’t a fan of “Star Wars,” Netflix does have a few other movies joining this week.“Mohawk” is probably your best bet. It’s a horror movie that focuses on a violent cat-and-mouse game between Native Americans and members of the early American military.Another streaming option is “TAU,” a horror offering about humans who are forced to help an AI computer get smarter by completing painful tasks. With hope of escape diminishing, the captives try to fight back against their robot captor. Check out the trailer for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” below (although you’ve likely already seen it, as the YouTube version alone has over 50 million views).And if you want to stay informed about what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter. This is part of Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on Netflix. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” | June 26Premise: A political faction called the Resistance is struggling to survive, while their enemy, the First Order, reigns supreme.With the Resistance on the brink of decimation, a long-shot effort is made to convince an old war hero to come join the fight.The lines of good and evil eventually become blurred in this battle and multiple characters question what they’re even fighting for.Is it actually good? Yes.There have been hilarious efforts to claim this movie is terrible. (An especially funny example is the “Remake The Last Jedi” campaign featured in the tweet below.)But “The Last Jedi” is easily one of the best “Star Wars” movies in the franchise. It’s the only one that truly rises to seek answers to the philosophical questions so many have looked to these movies for in the past. What is the nature of good and evil in war? How should religion inform a well-lived life? Is a world with extreme haves and have-nots morally corrupt?As with all of the “Star Wars” movies, there are minor problems, of course. Characters act like idiotic children too often. Elements of the plot don’t hold up with much scrutiny.Still, this is an extremely fun and thoughtful movie. So many scenes are beautifully shot. The action sequences are thrilling. Despite the long runtime, it’s a movie well worth watching.Runtime: 2 hours, 32 minutesHere’s the trailer ...June 26 June 29  June 30",1
15,"Both Democrats and Republicans are pushing back against recent remarks made by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).At a Los Angeles rally on Saturday, Waters warned members of Trump’s Cabinet to be prepared for an onslaught of outrage wherever they go should they continue to support the administration’s controversial zero tolerance policy on undocumented immigrants.“You think we’re rallying now? You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said Waters, whose remarks came one day after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant because of her role in the Trump administration. “Already you have members of your Cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants ... protesters taking up at their house saying ‘no peace, no sleep.’”Waters took it a step further to encourage rally attendees to “make sure we show up wherever we have to show up.”“If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” the congresswoman said.Over the weekend, Sanders tweeted about getting kicked out of The Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia, after the owner said she had concerns about serving someone affiliated with the administration. In recent weeks, senior adviser Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were also confronted while dining.The incident involving Sanders and Waters’ response to it are now creating a larger conversation about civility and its place in politics.On Sunday, “The View” host Meghan McCain called Waters’ impassioned speech “extremely dangerous.”“This is absolutely insane,” McCain tweeted, later inciting the famous former FLOTUS Michelle Obama quote: “Don’t ever again give me any of the ‘when they go low, we go high’ lip service.”McCain’s sentiments were echoed by many members of the GOP and several journalists on a panel on CNN Monday morning.RealClearPolitics editor A.B. Stoddard said Waters is “doing everything she can to prevent her own promotion” as chair of the Financial Services Committee.“This is beyond overreach,” Stoddard said during the panel of her comments. “It is so outrageous that she is trying to motivate voters on her side to be as divisive as President Trump. I just find it really unbelievable that this is the kind of thing they’re trying to stoke this mob mentality on the left. It’s the exact thing that will drive turnout on the other side.”White House reporter Brian Karem, who has gone head-to-head with Sanders before, said he “would have served her.”“What happened to just a little bit of civility?” he asked.On Monday, House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added fuel to that fire and tweeted that while Waters’ response to the incident might have been predictable, it’s “unacceptable.” President Donald Trump tweeted in response to Waters’ remarks on Monday, calling the congresswoman an “extraordinarily low IQ person.” He also suggested Waters encouraged people to harm his supporters, when she did not.Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday on the House floor that he “strongly” disagrees “with those who advocate harassing folks who disagree with you.”“No one should call for the harassment of political opponents,” he said.When discussing the Red Hen incident on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said he thinks the Virginia restaurant owner should have served Sanders.Cummings did not mention Waters specifically but discussed his disapproval for the current incivility in politics.“This tone is horrible. But again, I think President Trump has created this,” Cummings said. “Since he became president and even before, he has basically given people license to state things that are ugly.”This article has been updated with comment from Schumer. ",1
16,"Maryland enacted a wide-reaching package of gun violence prevention laws last week, becoming one of just a handful of states to get behind little-known measures that could save hundreds of lives and millions of dollars.The measure, the Public Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2018, was designed to address urban violence, an issue that gets relatively little attention in the U.S. gun debate — it’s the mass shootings like Newtown, Las Vegas and Parkland that make the headlines — despite accounting for most of the 13,000 firearm homicides and 60,000 nonfatal shootings that take place across the nation each year. The bill sets aside $5 million in the coming year to fund grants for programs that have been effective at making violence-stricken neighborhoods more peaceful.Maryland is now one of just six states funding gun violence prevention and intervention programs. California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York have been making modest investments for a number of years, and data suggest it has paid off in target cities, with substantial declines in shootings and violent crime, according to a recent report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national nonprofit founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).The sponsor of the Maryland legislation, Democratic Delegate Brooke Lierman, said she felt compelled to act amid a murder epidemic in Baltimore, which saw more than 1,000 homicides from 2015 to 2017.“What’s happening in Baltimore is a tragedy, as is what’s happening in other areas of the country where we are seeing homicide after homicide, death after death, day in and day out,” she told HuffPost. “Every dollar that we spend to prevent those deaths is definitely a dollar worth spending.”Baltimore has already seen success with a prevention model called Cure Violence, a public health strategy that addresses the causes of violence. Case workers provide street outreach to those at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence and mediate conflicts before they boil over. Neighborhoods that have adopted the program have seen far fewer shootings, with some recording periods of more than a year without a homicide, Lierman said.Anti-violence advocates say contributing to these programs makes financial sense. Gun violence costs the U.S. an estimated $229 billion each year, according to a 2012 study that measured direct spending on law enforcement, criminal justice and health care as well as indirect costs like lost wages and the effects of shootings on victims’ quality of life.Taxpayers often end up picking up a substantial portion of the tab for this violence. Many shooting victims don’t have private health insurance, and it’s expensive to prosecute and imprison perpetrators.Previous studies have calculated that taxpayers shoulder an average of $464,000 in costs for each gun homicide and as much as $40,000 for each nonfatal shooting. In Maryland, gun violence costs taxpayers approximately $294 million every year, according to an estimate by Giffords based on those studies.Supporters of this type of state-level initiative recognize that the problem of daily gun violence tends to be confined to cities, often to specific neighborhoods. But for people outside those areas, ignoring the issue comes at a cost too.“Even if you live in a suburban neighborhood where gun violence isn’t affecting you day to day, you are directly paying for the gun violence in nearby cities,” said Mike McLively, the director of the Urban Gun Violence Initiative at Giffords. “If you can’t get on board for moral reasons, you should at least be able to get on board for economic reasons.”But the fact that there has been so little support for and attention paid to prevention programs reveals a lot about the gun debate. Urban communities, particularly communities of color, face a shockingly disproportionate share of gun violence in the U.S.Of the 13,000 victims of gun homicides in 2015, over 8,500 were men of color, according to the Giffords report. Black men account for nearly half of firearm homicide victims each year but make up only 6 percent of the population. This phenomenon, known as murder inequality, is one of the many racial disparities that plague urban neighborhoods in the form of poverty, lack of employment opportunity and disinvestment in education and social services.Despite those figures, the mass shootings in affluent, predominantly white communities like Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, most frequently drive the conversation as well as the ensuing policy agenda on gun violence.With those isolated tragedies in mind, it makes sense that some people support tightening gun laws and restricting access to certain weapons as a response. In communities like Newtown, where there hasn’t been a murder since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, according to federal data, and Parkland, which hadn’t seen a gun homicide for at least a decade before the February shooting, a mass shooting may be residents’ only experience with gun violence.There is disagreement over how effective certain popular gun control proposals would be at preventing mass shootings. But it seems unlikely that a measure like banning bump stocks would do much to stem the routine bloodshed in cities, where most lives are being lost.This doesn’t mean state lawmakers shouldn’t continue to advocate for stronger gun laws as part of a comprehensive approach to preventing violence, said Lierman, who supported the complete package of firearms legislation in Maryland. But in states where gun politics is more contentious, she said, a plan like hers could give legislators a way to make a dent in violence without having to wade into a debate about gun control.“It has absolutely nothing to do with taking away guns, and it should be exactly the kind of initiative that everybody, including gun enthusiasts, can support,” she said. “It is all about creating programs to stop gun violence.”At a committee hearing for Lierman’s bill in February, pro-gun-rights lobbyists found reasons to oppose the effort.The NRA would be “more comfortable if there were language included that recognizes the individual right to keep and bear arms,” a representative for the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action said during testimony. She said the organization couldn’t commit to supporting the bill even if it were amended in that manner.John Jocelyn of the NRA-affiliated Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore criticized the legislation for placing too much focus on the issue of violence with firearms and not enough on issues like “rebuilding families.”“The program in itself can’t succeed unless we address the foundation issues to begin with,” he said. He went on to encourage lawmakers to reintroduce the bill in a future session, when they could “address the entire massive problem we face.”They were the lone opposing voices.“I was disappointed but not surprised,” said Lierman. “The NRA has apparently decided it needs to oppose anything that has to do with decreasing gun violence.”",1
17,"Firearm enthusiasts and protesters are expected to gather in downtown Dallas on Friday for the beginning of the National Rifle Association’s Annual Meetings ― a hotly politicized three-day event filled with high-profile speeches, educational seminars and, of course, lots of guns.It’s an opportune moment for the convention, now in its 147th year, as the NRA looks to rally gun-rights supporters who find themselves on the defensive amid a heated debate about firearms in America.That’s something of an unfamiliar position for the nation’s leading gun group. Political enthusiasm for gun reform has typically ebbed and flowed in the past, but the momentum appears to have shifted somewhat against the NRA in recent months, following a year of bloody mass shootings in places like Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida.Support for stricter gun laws reached 67 percent in March, the highest level in 25 years, according to Gallup ― though more recent surveys suggest the energy may be starting to taper off.Survivors of the February massacre at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have emerged as the face of the resurgent movement, whose members have been quick to portray the NRA as public enemy No. 1 in their campaign for stronger gun laws. The father of one of the slain students is slated to appear at a protest against the NRA in Dallas on Saturday.President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are scheduled to appear at the convention on Friday and address a forum for the NRA’s Institute for Legal Action, the organization’s lobbying arm. Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, both Republicans from Texas, are also speaking at the gathering, as are Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and a number of top NRA officials.Trump’s speech on Friday will mark his fourth consecutive appearance at the NRA’s annual conference. Last year, he became the first sitting president to attend the confab since Ronald Reagan in 1983.Attendees of the NRA convention will have the weekend to check out firearms, ammunition and accessories from more than 800 companies, partake in an instructional seminar on concealed carry and get a book signed by former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke. A number of country music acts will also be on hand, including the Charlie Daniels Band, Travis Tritt and the Randy Rogers Band.The NRA says 80,000 members will be in Dallas for the gathering, which it’s billing as the largest in the event’s history.The tone will likely be different outside Dallas’ Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, where national gun violence prevention groups and other local activist organizations plan to hold protests throughout the weekend.The counterprogramming includes a “die-in” demonstration on Friday evening, and a student-led rally on Saturday in support of a universal background check law and a ban on bump stocks and high-capacity ammunition magazines.A separate event on Saturday at Belo Garden Park, a few blocks from the convention center, is expected to feature actress Alyssa Milano and Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed in the shooting at Stoneman Douglas.At his speech last year, Trump vowed to “come through” for the NRA, which spent over $11 million in support of his presidential campaign and nearly $20 million more to attack his rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After briefly hinting that he might be willing to defy the NRA and support changes to gun laws in the wake of the Parkland shooting, Trump met privately with the group’s leaders at the White House in March and reaffirmed his allegiance.But Trump has yet to deliver on the promise he made to the NRA faithful last year. After the 2016 election, the NRA had high hopes that Republicans in control of the White House and Congress would be able to deliver on two key priorities: eliminating federal regulations on the sale of gun silencers, also known as suppressors, and passing a concealed-carry reciprocity law, which would allow handgun owners in more gun-friendly states to carry their firearms in states with more restrictive laws.Neither of those measures has progressed, nor has any other gun legislation at the federal level. Meanwhile, there has been some movement on gun control at the state level with efforts to ban bump stocks ― accessories that allow semiautomatic rifles to simulate automatic fire ― and to pass “red flag” laws, which give police more power to confiscate weapons from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others.",1
18,"The school shooting that took place in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year launched a new generation of gun control activists, inspired walkouts and marches, and sparked the most substantial ― and long-lasting ― shift in public opinion on guns in recent years. The appetite for gun control appears to have tapered off in the following weeks, but some surveys indicate that some changes in public opinion could endure. In the more than two months since that shooting, HuffPost and YouGov have conducted five surveys tracking Americans’ views on guns. The results show a burst of support for gun reform in the two weeks after the shooting, followed by a gradual reversion to the mean. Once-heightened concerns about gun violence have tapered back to previous levels, as has a desire for stricter gun laws and a belief that gun restrictions can be passed without violating Second Amendment rights.A few changes in thought, however, seem to have stuck. The percentage of Americans who believe it’s politically possible to pass gun laws has dropped several points since its high in late February, but it’s still higher than it was in the aftermath of last year’s massacres in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas.In the most recent survey, one-fifth of Americans also chose gun policies as one of the two issues they found most important. That remains a noticeable, if modest, uptick from the 13 percent who chose it as a priority following the shooting in Sutherland Springs. Other polling since the Parkland shooting also suggested gun control was carrying greater-than-usual prominence on the campaign trail, although it’s unclear how much of that energy will remain until November.That public opinion shifted at all in the wake of the shooting was striking. It’s even more striking that it lasted as long as it did. Last year’s shootings, by contrast, appeared to have little effect on Americans’ views about guns.One illustration of the uncommon nature of this year’s debate comes from Google Trends, which tracks the level interest in various search terms. According to that data, searches for “mass shooting” usually dwarf searches for “gun control” in the aftermath of an incident, and both disappear soon after. After the Parkland shooting, though, interest in gun control significantly outpaced attention to the shooting itself.Even now, specific gun reform proposals remain broadly popular. In the most recent survey, conducted in mid-April, three-quarters of Americans favored strengthening background checks, while just 13 percent opposed the proposal. A 63 percent majority favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21, with only about one-quarter in opposition. And a 42 percent plurality of those polled said President Donald Trump was not doing enough to pass new gun laws, while about one-quarter said he’s doing the right amount. Just 9 percent that he’s doing too much. (At the end of February, 37 percent said Trump wasn’t doing enough.)Data from other pollsters, meanwhile, suggests that the national focus on guns is waning. But some find that the decline has stopped short of entirely erasing the changes post-Parkland.Some of the most granular information comes from the progressive pollster Civiqs, which has been tracking data on gun control for several years. According to its data, voters’ backing for such restrictions spiked from the low 50s prior to the Parkland shooting to a high of 60 percent ― a bigger reaction than in the wake of mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs. Some of that change wore off in the weeks after, stabilizing around the 55 percent mark.Civiqs’ data only goes back through 2015. But support for enacting new gun laws in April was higher than it was after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in 2012, according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey, thanks largely to a movement among Democratic-leaning groups. A 53 percent majority of Americans told pollsters they believed student activism on guns were part of a lasting movement, while 43 percent said the rallies were “more of a one-time thing.”Another poll from Gallup found that the share of Americans mentioning guns or gun control as the nation’s most important problem dropped from 13 percent in March to 6 percent in April ― a downtick that nevertheless leaves it as one of the highest-ranked national issues. In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist poll, a slim 53 percent majority of Democratic voters said guns will be a major factor for them in November, down 21 points since February. “This finding raises a cautionary flag for voters who want gun policy to be front and center this election cycle,” Marist polling director Lee Miringoff told NPR.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the most recent HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:",1
20,"In the years before he allegedly shot up a Tennessee Waffle House last Sunday, Travis Reinking, 29, told police that Taylor Swift was stalking him. He said he heard people barking like dogs. He told his family he wanted to kill himself. He was also a legal gun owner known to carry around an AR-15 rifle.By the time he was arrested at the White House in July 2017 for breaching an outer barrier of the complex and demanding to meet the president, Reinking had established a pattern of erratic and sometimes violent behavior. If someone had looked for signs of an individual who might be unfit to own a firearm, Reinking exhibited red flag upon red flag.After his arrest last year, Reinking was sentenced to 32 hours of community service on a misdemeanor charge of unlawful entry. But federal officials also thought his guns might be a problem.The FBI and Secret Service contacted law enforcement in Reinking’s home state of Illinois and convinced them to revoke his gun license, known as a firearm owner’s identification or FOID, and to confiscate four firearms and a cache of ammunition. A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the specifics of that request, citing an open investigation.Once police obtained the guns, they turned them over to Reinking’s father, Jeffrey, a licensed gun owner. He “was advised that he needed to keep the weapons secure and away from Travis,” a police report said. Yet at some point, the father has since told police, he returned the guns to his son. According to law enforcement, Reinking used one of those firearms, the AR-15, to kill four people and injure several more inside a Waffle House restaurant near Nashville on April 22.Reinking’s possession of that rifle underscores a larger issue: the difficulty of removing guns from people who are legally prohibited from owning them.“This is one of the glaring gaps in our nation’s firearm laws,” said Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “In most cases, when someone becomes prohibited from owning a gun for any reason, we don’t have many mechanisms in place to make them relinquish their guns.”Under federal law, certain people are not allowed to own guns. That includes anyone convicted of a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor and anyone “adjudicated as a mental defective” or “committed to any mental institution.” Many states have similar laws on the books.Generally, once a person is prohibited from having guns, they’ll be notified that it’s illegal for them to remain armed, and their name will be flagged in the federal background check system to stop future purchases. But the process of physically removing firearms they already own ― called relinquishment ― varies depending on the state.The system almost worked in Illinois, which has some of the strongest gun laws in the country. The state requires background checks on all gun sales, and gun owners must have a permit. It is also one of the rare states with a procedure in place to remove guns from individuals once they lose the right to own them.But the law has a weakness: It allows people who cannot own guns to pass them along to anyone with a valid gun license, even relatives who live in the same house.“When somebody’s guns are taken by police because their FOID card is revoked, they only lose the right to possess those firearms. They don’t lose title or ownership interest in those firearms,” explained Brendan Bukalski, an Illinois criminal defense attorney. “Under Illinois law, that person gets to designate who they want to have the firearms given to.”It’s common for states to allow prohibited individuals to transfer their firearms to a third party, who may then let those guns fall right back into the wrong hands, Freilich said.“In too many cases, those closest to the person are unable or unwilling to keep guns out of their hands,” he said. The better practice is to mandate that relinquished firearms go to law enforcement or a licensed gun dealer.California is a leader in this area. In 2016, the state passed a law by ballot initiative that requires anyone convicted of a firearm-prohibiting crime ― such as felonies, illegal weapons use or misdemeanors involving domestic abuse ― to provide receipts showing that they sold or transferred their firearms to a licensed gun dealer or law enforcement agency within a specified time period. Enforcing these rules can be a challenge, however, and California authorities have been struggling to clear a backlog of prohibited individuals who may still own guns.William Rosen, deputy legal director for advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, said that even though Illinois law ultimately didn’t prevent the shooting in Tennessee, it’s essential for states to have a process for flagging dangerous people and revoking their access to firearms.“In most states, there are no laws on the books that would prohibit even someone with all of these obvious warning signs of dangerousness,” he said.Removing guns from those who aren’t supposed to have them has been a high priority for domestic violence activists for years. Only 17 states require people under final restraining orders for domestic violence to turn in their firearms once they’re prohibited from owning them. States that do so have lower rates of intimate partner homicide.Taking firearms away from individuals deemed to be a risk is also a key component of “red flag laws,” which have picked up steam in the wake of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.Red flag laws, also called gun violence restraining orders or GVROs, allow family members and law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from a person who is believed to be a danger to themselves or others, even if they haven’t been convicted of a crime.The gunman who killed 17 inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was well-known to local police for his disturbing and threatening behavior. But they had no power to confiscate his firearms because he had not been convicted or even charged with a crime.Florida passed a red flag law after the Parkland massacre, as have Vermont and Maryland. At least 25 other states and the District of Columbia have considered similar bills this year.Illinois doesn’t have a red flag law, but state lawmakers are debating such legislation. Following the Tennessee shooting, the legislature is reportedly considering a provision that would prohibit people forced to relinquish firearms under this process from transferring those weapons to relatives.A separate 2013 Illinois law requires physicians, psychologists, law enforcement officials and school administrators to report to state police if they believe a person poses a “clear and present danger” to themselves or others, so their gun license can be revoked.Police reports obtained by HuffPost reveal a string of troubling incidents involving Reinking in the years before the shooting. Law enforcement knew he was armed and had expressed unstable and suicidal thoughts.“Travis is hostile towards police and does not recognize police authority. Travis also possesses several firearms,” a Tazewell County, Illinois, sheriff’s deputy wrote in a May 2016 report, after responding to what was documented as a “suicide attempt by firearms.” Police ended up taking Reinking against his will to a nearby hospital for evaluation.“Travis has some mental problems and I asked him if he would like to speak to [medical personnel] but he stated he didn’t want to. Travis had already spoke to them before and been in the hospital,” an officer wrote in a June 2017 report, following an episode in which Reinking had allegedly brandished his AR-15 in front of employees of his father’s company.Still, it wasn’t until Reinking’s arrest at the White House that authorities finally decided he might not be suited for firearms ownership. Unfortunately, his father didn’t appear to agree with their determination.",1
0,"Major media outlets urgently call for gun control as President Trump stresses the need to address America's mental health issues; reaction from Jamie Weinstein, host of the 'Jamie Weinstein Show' on National Review, and Ethan Bearman, radio talk host show and author.Gun control advocates are only too sure that they occupy the moral high ground. In the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida high school shooting that left 17 dead, they are accusing their opponents of having “blood on their hands.”It’s no longer just activists such as Chelsea Handler who are spewing such vitriol. Even mainstream liberals such as political scientist Norm Ornstein use the phrase.Gun control advocates’ new hot number is that there have been 18 school shootings so far this year, but this is a gross exaggeration.To get 18, one has to count all instances from kindergarten through college where a gun was fired on or near school property. This includes a case of a police officer accidentally discharging his gun, as well as suicides – such as that of a 31-year-old military veteran with no connection to the school who killed himself in the school parking lot.Excluding suicides, there have only been five cases where someone was actually shot at a K-12 school. Four actually involved a gun being fired on school property, and two of those resulted in fatalities.In fact, gun control advocates’ proposals would do more harm than good. They are the ones opposing life-saving laws.Every time there's a mass public shooting, gun control advocates call for more background checks. President Obama did so each time he spoke after a mass public shooting. Gun control advocates like to think this is a magic solution that would have prevented Wednesday’s massacre.The proposed background check laws wouldn't have prevented the attack in Florida, nor any other mass public shooting that’s happened in the 21st century.But the background checks come at a real cost, ranging from $55 in Oregon to $125 in New York City and Washington, D.C.With millions of mistaken denials because of “false positives,” the checks have confused the names of law-abiding good citizens with those who really are prohibited from owning guns. It is the most vulnerable people – poor minorities – who are kept from being able to protect themselves and their families.Some, such as Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., reacted to Wednesday’s attack by immediately decrying the failure to keep people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns.But many on the terrorist watch list are not suspected of being terrorist threats, and of the 2,000 people who have bought guns, not a single one has been accused of using a gun in a crime. The bill prohibiting such purchases never got passed because the Democrats didn’t want to pass it.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, offered an alternative. Under his proposal, the U.S. attorney general could deny a person on the terrorist watch list the ability to purchase a gun, but would need to prove probable cause within 72 hours. Otherwise, some unnamed government bureaucrat could arbitrarily add a person to the terror list and the person would lose his right to self-defense.Democrats said that the time limit was too short. But instead of proposing a longer time period, they fought against any judicial review.Others mention a new assault weapon ban, but even research funded by the Clinton administration concluded that the previous ban and limit on magazine size had “no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.”Those who are blaming the Florida attack on large capacity magazines that can hold more bullets don’t understand how quickly magazines can be changed or how incredibly easy they are to make.But while Democrats keep pushing for gun control laws that won’t help, they won’t discuss the one change that might have made a difference: abolishing gun-free zones, where the defenselessness of general citizens is guaranteed by law.It is hard to ignore that all the mass public shootings in Florida – including the Orlando nightclub, the Orlando RV business, the Fort Lauderdale Airport, the Hialeah restaurant, as well as Wednesday’s at the high school – were places where guns are banned.Nationwide, over 98 percent of such mass shootings attacks since 1950 have also been in gun-free zones.These killers might be crazy, but they aren’t stupid. They want to kill as many people as possible. Killers in attacks – including the Charleston church, the Colorado “Batman” movie theater and Santa Barbara, California – explained that they picked defenseless targets where they knew no one would have a gun.What is interesting is that even though gun control advocates are refusing the types of policies that will really save lives, they are claiming that others “have blood on their hands.” That same language hasn’t been used against them.

2,"Press secretary pays tribute to victims' acts of heroism, says American spirit cannot and will not be broken.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday chided congressional Democrats -- and Hillary Clinton -- for sounding the call for gun control within hours of the Las Vegas massacre. “There is a time and a place for political debate but now is the time for the country to come together,” Sanders said at the daily briefing. “This is an unspeakable tragedy. Today is a day for consoling survivors and mourning those who were lost.”Sanders noted that the investigation into Sunday's attack is still ongoing, and a motive is yet to be determined. “It is premature to discuss policy when we don’t know all the facts,” Sanders said. Nevertheless, Clinton was out early Monday with a series of tweets going after the NRA and silencers -- questioning how much worse the massacre might have been if silencers had been used.“The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer which the NRA wants to make easier to get,” she tweeted. “Our grief isn’t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.”The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.TRUMP, IN A SOMBER ADDRESS, CALLS LAS VEGAS SHOOTING AN 'ACT OF PURE EVIL'Clinton’s comments seemed to reference the NRA’s push to ease federal rules for silencers. She soon took heat from critics who called her remarks “ignorant” and “irrelevant” -- noting silencers in this case probably would not been dampened the sound very much. Asked about Clinton's tweets, Sanders told reporters she hadn’t spoken with the president on the issue, but underscored that the investigation into the massacre is ongoing.“I think before we start trying to talk about the preventions of what took place last night, we need to know more facts, and right now we’re simply not at that point,” Sanders said. “It is very easy for Mrs. Clinton to criticize and to come out, but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is that of the shooter, and this isn’t a time for us to go after individuals or organizations. I think we can have those policy conversations, but today is not that day.”The shooting at a country concert outside Las Vegas’ Mandalay Bay resort left 58 people dead and more than 500 people hospitalized, making the horrific tragedy  the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The shooter was identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock.Sanders told reporters that the president was briefed on the attack early Monday morning by his Chief of Staff John Kelly and has been updated “regularly and constantly” throughout the day. “I’ve seen him today and I think he, like most of America, is saddened and certainly his heart and compassion goes out to those who are affected,” Sanders said. “Today is more a day of reflection, mourning, and gratefulness for those that were saved.”But Sanders underscored the president’s commitment to the Second Amendment, saying “he’s been clear” that he is a “supporter,” and that likely has not changed.HILLARY CLINTON SLAMMED FOR 'IGNORANT' STATEMENT ON GUNS AFTER LAS VEGAS SHOOTINGThe shooting prompted swift calls from Democratic lawmakers for tighter gun legislation.Connecticut’s Democratic senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, both issued statements calling for tighter gun laws on Monday.“It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something,” Murphy said in a statement.When asked about Murphy’s comments in the briefing, Sanders said she agreed that Congress “should get up and do something,” taking a shot at the legislative branch for having “several months” of “doing very little.”“We don’t want to try to create laws that won’t stop these types of things from happening,” Sanders said, citing the example of Chicago, a city with some of the “strictest gun laws in the country” and some of the highest murder rates. “When that time comes, we have to look at things that may have real impact.”Sanders on Monday also tackled the thorny subject of North Korea, backing up the president after he tweeted over the weekend telling his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to stop wasting time negotiating with Kim Jong Un's regime. “I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!”TRUMP: TALKING TO KIM JONG UN A WASTE, 'WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE' Sanders echoed the statements, saying they have put ""diplomatic pressure"" on the rogue nation, but ""now is not the time to have conversations with North Korea.""Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

                                The media’s pro-gun control bias doesn’t just distort news coverage. TV networks have used their primetime entertainment shows to portray gun rights advocates as dishonest, extremist and unconcerned about the loss of innocent lives. At the same time, advocates of gun control are portrayed as caring, upstanding and responsible citizens.The gun control debate isn’t portrayed as having two sides. It’s a morality play of good versus evil.NBC might be the worst network, but it’s a tight race. It seems to have given marching orders to its TV writers to churn out scripts demonizing law-abiding gun owners and lionizing those who want to slap strict new controls on gun ownership, even if that means disregarding the Second Amendment to the Constitution.Recently the NBC show “Taken” (Season 2, Episode 11) tried to convey to viewers that gun-free zones work because the criminals won’t disobey the bans.Santana (Jessica Camacho) asks Bryan Mills (Clive Standen), if he is “OK with this whole no-guns thing.” Mills replies that it is OK because the gun-free zone means that “bad guys won’t have them either.”Do people really think that a group of paid, professional killers couldn’t find some way to get guns into a hospital, a school or some other place just because a sign is posted saying guns are not allowed? There’s no mention that over 98 percent of mass public shootings since 1950 have occurred in places where guns are banned. This is precisely because criminals prefer unarmed victims.About a month ago the NBC show “Chicago Fire” (Season 6, Episode 15) had a scene where stored ammunition catches fire. Bullets fly everywhere, seriously wounding one of the firefighters. The firefighters think that a sniper is targeting them. It is hard to believe that anyone would want to have a gun in their home after watching this scene.But the scene is complete fiction. A gun barrel is needed to harness a gunpowder explosion so a bullet can be propelled forward. Outside of a gun, the gunpowder in a bullet would simply explode in all directions, producing very little energy to actually push the bullet forward.A February episode of NBC’s “The Black List” (Season 5, Episode 13) begins with a group of people accusing a gun maker of providing inexpensive guns that “have no value to anyone but criminals.” The gun maker is profiting “off blood money,” because gun “sales drive up homicide rates.”There is even a dig about how the law protects the gun maker from being sued for purposefully killing people. The gun seller’s only response is that everything he doing is perfectly legal. No one mentions that poor people, particularly poor minorities, are the most likely victims of violent crime and that they use inexpensive guns for self-defense.NBC’s “Chicago P.D.” shows no less egregious bias in an episode from February (Season 5, Episode 13). Gang members threaten a small business owner, who a police officer advises to leave his permitted concealed handgun at home.The owner doesn’t follow the instructions and ends up killed by the gang members, his gun lying next to his dead body. To leave nothing to viewers’ imagination, a later scene shows surveillance camera footage of the businessman being beaten to death because he drew his gun on the gang members.You wouldn't know it from watching the show, but having a gun is the safest course of action when confronted by a criminal. The police can’t be everywhere all the time to protect everyone. The only message is that the man would still be alive if he'd left his gun at home.Of course, NBC is hardly alone. In January, CBS’ “Hawaii 5-0” showed an unhinged concealed handgun permit holder unsuccessfully trying to kill someone. Later, the permit holder proudly proclaims to the police that it is alright for him to have his gun because of his permit.Of course, there is no mention that permit holders are incredibly law-abiding, or that they are convicted of firearms violations at even lower rates than police.In ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” the U.S. President (Kiefer Sutherland), takes a question from a woman whose daughter was killed by an ex-boyfriend who’d been in prison. She claims that background checks would have stopped the ex-con from buying a gun.But viewers are unlikely to know about the voluminous research that background checks don’t reduce crime. Nor that virtually all the 3 million people who have been stopped from buying a gun were barred because government confused law-abiding people’s names with those of prohibited people.These background checks are expensive, and again, the costs are most difficult to bear for poor individuals, many of them minorities living in high-crime areas.But the show takes a more simplistic view of the gun debate. On one side are people who are desperately trying to pass a law that everyone agrees would save lives. On the other side are Republicans using lies to derail the bill. It is bad enough that news programs provide only one side of the gun control debate. But even in entertainment shows, Americans can’t escape a biased, distorted view of gun ownership.John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com.

5,"President floats ideas to prevent future mass school shootings; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel.After each mass public shooting in the U.S. – such as the horrific attack at a Florida high school last week that killed 17 people – gun control advocates keep pointing to Australia as the role model America should follow to reduce gun deaths.If only reducing crime and suicides was so easy. In reality, gun control efforts in Australia have not been as successful as we’ve been led to believe.In fact, the only proven policy to stop gun attacks is deterrence – by allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and others, as President Trump correctly pointed out Thursday on Twitter and in remarks at the White House.The president tweeted: “If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school.” The president added: “Cowards won’t go there ... problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!”European countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands have even stricter gun control laws than Australia does, but their mass public shooting rates are at least as high as those in the United States.This effective action proposed by the president has been greeted with disdain by most of the media. Instead, news organizations such as USA Today, the New York Times and the Washington Post have all run stories in recent days crediting Australia’s 1996-1997 gun buyback program with cutting the firearm homicide and suicide rates in half, and eliminating mass public shootings. Our friends in Australia have been only too eager to offer advice telling us to follow their example. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently offered to explain to Americans the best gun control regulations. Over this past weekend a church in Australia got international attention for putting up a sign saying: “When will they love their kids more than their guns.” Responding, anti-gun politicians from Hillary Clinton to President Obama have pointed to Australia’s gun laws as a model that we should closely examine.But looking at simple before-and-after averages of gun deaths in Australia regarding the gun buyback is extremely misleading. Firearm homicides and suicides were falling from the mid-1980s onwards, so you could pick out any subsequent year and the average firearm homicide and suicide rates after that year would be down compared to the average before it. The question is whether the rate of decline changed after the gun buyback law went into effect. But the decline in firearm homicides and suicides actually slowed down after the buyback.Australia’s buyback resulted in almost 1 million guns being handed in and destroyed, but after that private gun ownership once again steadily increased and now exceeds what it was before the buyback. In fact, since 1997 gun ownership in Australia grew over three times faster than the population (from 2.5 million to 5.8 million guns).Gun control advocates should have predicted a sudden drop in firearm homicides and suicides after the buyback, and then an increase as the gun ownership rate increased again. But that clearly didn’t happen. For other crimes, such as armed robbery, what happened is the exact opposite of what was predicted. The armed robbery rate soared right after the gun buyback, then gradually declined.  Gun control advocates like to note that there has been no mass public shooting in Australia since the buyback. But they are simply picking out a country that happens to “prove” what they want it to prove. European countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands have even stricter gun control laws than Australia does, but their mass public shooting rates are at least as high as those in the United States.During the Obama administration, the per capita casualty rate from shootings in the European Union was actually 27 percent higher than the U.S. rate.Even excluding fights over sovereignty and including the recent attacks in Las Vegas, the Texas church shooting in November, and the Florida school massacre, the number of mass shootings in the rest of the world has been much worse than in the U.S. since at least as far back as 1970.Many point to the widely covered work by the University of Alabama’s Adam Lankford, who claims that 31 percent of mass public shootings from 1966 to 2012 have occurred in the U.S. But Lankford’s totals don’t line up with others, and he has refused repeated requests to release a list of his cases.New Zealand also provides a useful comparison to Australia. They are both isolated, island nations, and have similar socioeconomics and demographics. Their mass murder rates were nearly identical prior to Australia’s gun buyback. From 1980 to 1996, Australia’s mass murder rate was 0.0042 incidents per 100,000 people. New Zealand’s was 0.0050 incidents per 100,000 people. After 1997, both countries experienced similar drops in mass murders, even though New Zealand had not altered its gun control laws. It would be just as misleading for gun control critics to cite only New Zealand as it is for gun control advocates to cite Australia. The right approach is to look at a lot of similar places and see what gun control measures actually made a difference. To do just that, Bill Landes of the University of Chicago and I collected data on all multiple-victim public shootings in all the United States from 1977 to 1999. We examined 13 different gun control policies, including: waiting periods, registration, background checks, bans on assault weapons, the death penalty, and harsher penalties for committing a crime with a firearm. But only one policy reduced the number and severity of mass public shootings: allowing victims to defend themselves with permitted, concealed handguns. Since 1950, all but six U.S. mass public shootings have happened in areas where general citizens were banned from having guns. And in Europe, every single mass public shooting has occurred where guns are banned. Killers have good reason to avoid places where people have guns. In dozens of cases concealed-carry gun permit holders have stopped mass public shootings. In the Texas church shooting last year, the killer was killing the wounded when a man living near the church shot him.Yet gun control advocates keep focusing on laws that won’t make any difference. None of the mass public shootings since at least 2000 would have been stopped by universal background checks.Relying on Australia requires a misreading of the evidence, and requires that we ignore what has happened in all the other countries with strict regulations. The truth is that gun control hasn't worked for anyone. John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com.

                                Josh Gad isn't holding back his feelings about Wednesday's Florida school shooting. On Thursday, the ""Frozen"" actor, who is from South Florida, shared the news that his friend's son was one of the 17 victims killed in the shooting attack. “Last night, I received a text while I slept that our friend’s son passed away from his gunshot wound,” Gad wrote on Twitter. “My grief for this family and the many others knows no bounds. I’m so sorry this happened. I’m so sorry our leaders are worthless. I’m so sorry we are bound to repeat this again.”Last night, I received a text while I slept that our friend’s son passed away from his gun shot wound. My grief for this family and the many others knows no bounds. I’m so sorry this happened. I’m so sorry our leaders are worthless. I’m so sorry we are bound to repeat this again.After his initial revelation, the actor shared a Twitter thread featuring the steps he was going to take to honor those killed in the shooting which includes fighting for gun control. The 36-year-old actor said that he would make sure to take action against those politicians who have ""NRA money behind them"" and that vote against increased gun laws.“I am going to make sure that I read and educate myself as to why certain people refuse to do anything that resembles sensible gun laws and make sure they face early retirement,” he wrote. “I am going to be here as a voice of reason and walk proudly and tall through the echoing winds of madness as we continue to demand action in a familiar sea of inaction … I am going to remember the 17 dead, the many injured, and the thousands of others who have senselessly lost their lives to gun violence and I am going to fight in their name so that other parents and siblings never have to [experience] such trauma.”The ""Beauty and the Beast"" actor ended his thread by asking followers what they will do in order to help make a change. We have to elect candidates that are not funded by the NRA in November. We have an opportunity to elect candidates who won’t allow kids to go to school and get shot. It is disgusting how many times this has happened and Republicans do nothing. You all have blood on your hands.Just heard the tragic news about Florida.

Fox News' Gillian Turner reports on the latest from Washington, D.C.Just one day after putting the NRA on the defensive with stunning televised comments, President Trump has signaled in an Oval Office meeting that he doesn't want gun control, according to the NRA's top lobbyist. Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, tweeted late Thursday that ""POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control.""I had a great meeting tonight with @realDonaldTrump & @VP. We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control. #NRA #MAGAAbout an hour later, Trump appeared to endorse Cox's version of events with a tweet of his own: ""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!On Wednesday, Trump shocked observers during a televised discussion with bipartisan lawmakers by appearing to endorse extreme gun control measures.“Take the guns first.

8,"President Trump backs efforts to improve federal gun background checks.After a 19-year-old man was accused of fatally shooting 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida last week, all eyes turned to Republican lawmakers – many of whom have had support of pro-gun organizations over the years.Thousands of students, parents and teachers attended rallies over the weekend in support of stronger gun control legislation. And many of them blamed politicians – particularly those who have accepted donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), a nonprofit that supports gun rights.Here’s a look at what 15 Republican senators have said about gun control in the aftermath of the deadly shooting on Feb. 14.When Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., was a student in Arkansas, he said it wasn’t uncommon for “young people to actually bring their rifles to school during deer season.” But, he told KARK-TV, “nobody at that time entertained the thought of doing such a horrendous thing” as shooting individuals in a school.Boozman says the ""heart of the problem"" facing the U.S. is a mix of drugs, gangs, mental health and the “break-up of the family,” which, he argued, can be the catalyst behind these recent tragedies.""Throwing money at the problem or passing a law that simply would not make any difference is not the answer – even though it might make us all feel better.""“My understanding is, if you look at all the instances like these that have happened in recent history, that all of the things that have been proposed in Congress to counter them would not have made any difference,” Boozman told KARK. “Throwing money at the problem or passing a law that simply would not make any difference is not the answer – even though it might make us all feel better.”He said he wants to see the country be able to more easily identify “these young white males that are definitely mentally ill, very unstable,” and be able to “somehow restrain them.”Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told the Bangor Daily News that she’s sponsored several bills in Congress that would prohibit people on a no-fly list from purchasing guns as well as strengthen background checks.“What happened [in Florida] is not only so horrific a tragedy, but it also has happened far too many times in this country,” she said.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has spoken to President Trump about a bipartisan bill designed to strengthen the FBI database of prohibited gun buyers, according to the White House.The bill, which he introduced last year alongside Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., would penalize federal agencies that fail to provide the necessary records and reward states that comply with federal grant preferences and other incentives.Appearing on Fox News, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, criticized Democrats for what he said was their attempt to “politicize” a tragedy – including by advocating to “take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.”Cruz mentioned the mass shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017 and said the survivors told him “gun control is not the answer.”“The answer is to focus on criminals, to focus on violent criminals,” Cruz said.The former presidential contender has also battled CNN in the wake of the shooting. The cable news network accused Cruz, along with other Republicans, of being “unwilling” to appear on CNN to talk about gun control.Cruz pushed back on Twitter, saying he did a 15-minute interview with CNN “about proactive solutions to prevent gun violence,” but said the network “aired NONE of it.”That's funny, I spoke to CNN for 15 mins yesterday about proactive solutions to prevent gun violence (like passing the Grassley-Cruz bill—which Dems filibustered—that would add $300 million for school safety) yet CNN has aired NONE of it.  Why not air the (entire) interview? https://t.co/c4GZcqTbs7After the shooting, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said there should be a balance between supporting existing gun laws and not restricting Second Amendment rights.“While we must enforce current federal gun laws to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands, we can and must do so in a way that respects our Constitution,” Ernst told KCCI-TV.""The root cause is not that we have the Second Amendment; it is that we’re not adequately addressing mental illness across the United States.""She also told reporters on a conference call that the problem isn’t guns, but societal issues that can be helped with better access to mental health services, the Des Moines Register reported.“The root cause is not that we have the Second Amendment,” Ernst said. “It is that we’re not adequately addressing mental illness across the United States. We need to focus on that, and we need to focus on substance abuse.”Like other Republicans, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., has said the school shooting should serve as an example for lawmakers to better improve mental health initiatives.“Now is the time to have a discussion about what we can do to break down the barriers that prevent help going to people who need it – whether that’s a substance abuse issue or whether that’s a mental health concern,” Gardner said, according to the Denver Post.Gardner called for a probe into whether authorities took earlier complaints about the alleged gunman seriously enough.  “We need to understand why those reports weren’t investigated or further action wasn’t taken,” he said.After the shooting, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told fellow lawmakers he planned to sit down with some of them to discuss gun legislation, CBS News reported.The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman responded to a request from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and said he would to talk to her and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.Both senators have introduced legislation pertaining to gun control. Feinstein, in particular, is seeking to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase rifles.Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., accused gun control advocates of attempting to “take a tragedy and try to capitalize on it.”“Every time there’s an incident, people somehow think if you take away guns from law-abiding citizens, the criminal element will give up their guns voluntarily,” Inhofe told WJLA-TV. “It doesn’t make sense to me.”.@JimInhofe: ""Every time there’s an incident, people somehow think if you take away guns from law-abiding citizens, the criminal element will give up their guns voluntarily. It doesn’t make sense to me” @OKCFOX #C2C pic.twitter.com/k9qxkpXU88According to Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., the “first way to stop a shooter is to shoot back.”Kennedy is advocating for active shooter drills and trained security personnel on hand in schools. He told WVUE-TV he's not going to support ""more gun control.""“I don't think gun control keeps guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have guns,” Kennedy said. “I think criminals and those who are mentally ill obey gun laws pretty much like politicians keep promises.”“I think our problem is not gun control; it’s idiot control,” he quipped.While he’s not on board with a ban of so-called assault weapons, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called for stronger background checks in the wake of the Florida school shooting.“The problem is not owning an AR-15, it’s the person who owns it,” Lankford told NBC News, adding that he doesn’t believe the AR-15 should be more difficult to buy.He pushed for reform to strengthen background checks on individuals purchasing firearms, especially in some “rural departments or federal entities.”Lankford strongly advocated for the “Fix NICS Act,” from Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn. The bill ""penalizes federal agencies who fail to properly report relevant records and incentivizes states to improve their overall reporting,"" Cornyn described in a post on his website.Like some of her Republican colleagues, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, focused on mental health efforts in the wake of the shooting.“I think we all know that there is no one single initiative that is going to be able to stop what happened in Florida or what has happened in — unfortunately — far too many other areas, where, again, you think there’s a level of safety and security and there’s not,” Murkowski told Vox.She added that Alaska has a “very serious deficiency when it comes to mental health providers.”In an interview with NPR, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., encouraged people not to get too caught up in the type of firearm used in the school shooting.“You can call any type of a series of different types of guns assault weapon, and suddenly then they become a demonized item,” Rounds said. “And then suddenly it sounds like we've done something. The reality is there's a whole lot of different types of weapons that can be utilized whether you're talking about a handgun, or you're talking about a shotgun, or you're talking about a rifle…”Rounds said Congress “could do a better job,” but added that he supports the Second Amendment.“All we have to do is take away one particular type of weapon – that suddenly becomes the discussion point. And suddenly we all feel good about having done something. And in reality, we haven’t done something,” he said.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has borne the brunt of criticism in the wake of the school shooting in his state, given his positions on gun control. He said the issue is ""complicated,” but “not unsolvable.”“If a bill makes things better, we should vote for it and keep working,"" Rubio told WFOR-TV. ""But we’re in an era now where everybody wants to get 100 percent of what they want or they’ll just walk away.""""There’s this false narrative out there that says just because you want to deal with mental illness means you don’t want to deal with the gun part.""Rubio said it should have been “impossible” for the alleged gunman in Parkland to have been able to obtain the firearm he did, though he added that he respects law-abiding citizens who want to own a weapon like an AR-15 for sport or protection.“There’s this false narrative out there that says just because you want to deal with mental illness means you don’t want to deal with the gun part. I’m willing to deal with the gun part. I don’t think people like this guy or people like him should be able to have any gun, not an AR-15, any gun. We need to create a system that keeps them from getting it,” Rubio said.Rubio also embraced a Democratic bill in the Florida legislature to allow courts to temporarily prevent people from having guns if they are determined to be a threat to themselves or others.After the deadly Florida shooting, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said the “system in place simply was not followed.""“We all say, ‘If you see something, say something,’” Scott told CBS News. “In [the] Parkland community, we saw people reporting there were 20 calls to the sheriff's department, they responded. The FBI received a legitimate, credible tip and it was not followed up upon.""On social media, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., assured the public of his commitment to “improving our federal background check system.”“I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them – criminals, the dangerously mentally ill and terrorists,” Toomey said.I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them--criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, and terrorists.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Kaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

11,"Can the president craft a deal that Congress can pass? Reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" February 28, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: This is a Fox News alert. We have breaking news out of the White House. We have just learned that White House communications director Hope Hicks is resigning from her post. This comes one day after she testified before the house intelligence committee about the Russia investigation. For more, we head over to chief White House correspondent John Roberts. John? JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS: This was a real shocker, Kimberly, there's no question about that. I mean, this is a -- if you look at everybody in the White House other than Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Melania Trump, this is a person who is closest to the president. I was in her office last week. And one wall of her office is one of the walls of the oval office. She is literally just outside the door. And she has been at President Trump side for some three years now, and she has been taking on an exhausting schedule. I mean, she probably reached burnout level back in 2015. She kept going, going, going and going. I am told by sources inside the White House that this was planned before her testimony yesterday, where she sat with the house intelligence committee members for some ten hours. And during which she said on occasions she has told, quote, white lies, on behalf of President Trump. She said it was nothing material to the Russia investigation. She was also at the center of that storm of controversy surrounding Rob Porter who was dismissed from the White House a couple weeks back on allegations of spousal abuse dating back to the early 2000's. I think this is not peg to any one thing here, but probably sort of a cascade of working yourself to the bone for three years, and then your personal life being dragged out there before the public, as well as her testimony yesterday. Maybe there's a sense that it was time to move on. But it will be difficult for the president to replace somebody like Hope Hicks from at least the standpoint of loyalty. I don't know of anybody at the White House except for immediate family that was as loyal to President Trump as Hope Hicks was. She released a statement this afternoon upon news of her resignation saying, quote, there are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump. I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country. From the president, Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. I will miss having her by my side. But when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future. It's interesting to point out that Hope Hicks announced her resignation shortly after Josh Raffel, who was also close to Hope Hicks, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, announced that he was leaving the communications shop as well. A replacement has not been named yet. But certainly, a favorite for the job inside the White House would be Mercedes Schlapp. She is the current director of strategic communications, moving her into the communications director spot would probably be a natural. The other person who had laudatory comments about Hope Hicks was chief of staff John Kelly, though some people will tell you that their relationship at times was tense. And again, Kimberly, no one reason given for her leaving -- no real reason given for her leaving other than she will be pursuing opportunities outside the White House. But I really think it was a lot of things all kind of came to bear the same time, and she probably figured enough is enough, it's time to pull the ripcord. Kimberly. GUILFOYLE: All right, John, thank you for that update. Obviously, Dana, big breaking news today with Hope Hicks, especially coming on the heels of her testimony, but I think for some time she was thinking about making an exit strategy from the White House. She has, obviously, been very devoted to President Trump, you know, his personal life, professional life, and his business prior to this, and now serving in the White House. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: It's very interesting -- there's several reasons that one might go into a White House. It's really hard to leave the White House. And this is a decision that nobody makes lightly. And you make it reluctantly, usually. Especially if you want to go out in the middle of a really important year after a lot of accomplishments that the administration finished out the year-on, so I think that going out on her own terms is really good. She has an incredibly bright future in front of her. She's also leaving on good terms with everybody inside the White House, based on the report that John Roberts just put forward. And she's a young woman with a lot of experience that she got in a short period of time. It is an amazing pressure cooker, not just from the job standpoint, but when you add a special council investigation on top of any White House staff. It is so intense. And you have to focus, you know, 24/7 on the job that you have, while at the same time you have to make time to meet with your lawyers and then go up to the hill and meet with the house intelligence committee. That won't end just because she's leaving the White House. I don't think that they'll just say, OK, there's nothing more to see here. But also, Maggie Haberman of the New York Times is saying similar things to John Roberts that this was planned for quite a while. The last thing I would say is that often it is good for a president to know who is able to go the distance in an election year, including a midterm election year, because if you think that you are not going to be able to be there a hundred percent, sprint to the finish until election day, it is usually better than to step aside and let somebody else do that. And I do wish her the very best. She represented women well in the White House. She's very quiet and she doesn't seek attention, and I always think -- that's unusual in today's politics. GUILFOYLE: Yes, she's definitely not a self-promoter. Very dedicated, very loyal, capable person. I think all of us know her personally. She's very nice person, pleasant to be around. I don't know. I like her a lot. Jesse? JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Disappointing day for the Trump White House. She's President Trump's most trusted and loyal aide. And he doesn't just rely on her for communications strategy, she travels with him. In a way she controls access of information in a similar way that John Kelly did. When you hear something like this, your mind always goes, oh, you know, the testimony situation, the personal life situation, is there chaos going on in the White House communications department? That's all speculation. It could be none of those things. It could be all of those things. So I don't want to make any judgment about that. I do know that she probably had the best reputation among all the people on the Trump staff. You never heard anything negative about her leaked in the press. There was never any bad story leaked about her by other people on the team. So that is to her credit because she's obviously a very likable person. Selfishly, she was my point of contact with the president. If I ever wanted to interview the president, I would go through her. And I did two or three interviews with President Trump when he was running and it was all set up by Hope Hicks. I'm scrambling now. I'm very upset about this. We have to find a new friend, but the sky the limit for her. She can go on and do many other things. She's very young, very talented, extremely well- connected, and a lot of people are saying now might be the time to bring back the mooch.GUILFOYLE: Juan?WATTERS: No comment. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't know what to say about the last one because the mooch's stay was pretty cataclysmic. WATTERS: I've enjoyed it.WILLIAMS: OK. GUILFOYLE: Watters world.WILLIAMS: So this is interesting to me on several counts. One is the high turnover rate in the Trump White House. I think, yesterday, when we're talking about this we said it's like 34 percent, more than double any other White House in the first year. The second thing is that you also have Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, having a reduced clearance. So he cannot function in terms of full national security briefing. (INAUDIBLE) That's no longer available to him. And apparently, that's a result of a clash between Jared Kushner and the White House chief of staff John Kelly. And there are also reports of some tension between Hicks and Kelly, so I don't know. Again, the president -- Kelly was restricting access to the president, access to documents. I don't know. And then, of course, as you pointed out, her personal life gets involved in this. It's sort of -- you know, she was going out with one guy, another guy, and the guy she's going out with is accused of spousal abuse and that brings up all sort of who is leaking what to whom? Was it a clash with lovers or what's going on? And finally. GUILFOYLE: I didn't hear all of that. I don't know about clash of lovers. WILLIAMS: OK. Lewandowski and Porter apparently were rivals for her affection. GUILFOYLE: OK. So that happens a lot every day. WILLIAMS: I'm just saying -- but she's in the spotlight. It's not like you and me in this situation. And then the other part of it is, I think, you got to understand that once she says she's telling white lies for President Trump that really does damage her credibility. Obviously, she was saying it to the investigators in order to say I didn't tell any big lies, but already people were joking that the title of her memoir will be White Lies, and that's just for communications director in Washington under pressure, just not the best. GUILFOYLE: But I don't think she's going to write that book.(CROSSTALK)BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST CO-HOST: In terms of (INAUDIBLE) with Kelly, I think Kelly respects confidence, judging by his remarks they aren't typical. He said when I became chief of staff, I quickly realize what so many have learned about Hope. She's strategic poised and wise beyond her years and it gets better from there. That's not how you write about somebody who's leaving. Great to see you. You know, hope to see you down -- you know, that's not it. He says some great things about her. But I will say this.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: I don't think he minds angering the president. I think that's pretty clear. But I think there's a lot of respect there. I worry the big picture for the president to have function and optimum to have people around that he trusts. You know, every president likes to have people from Harry Truman on back you go, I just need someone to look across who knew me when I was younger and knew me before I became president. He lost Keith who is his security guard.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: That's a big one. You know, Jared Kushner, if he had stepped back even though Ben Rhodes, evidently, had the same clearance, and he was pretty close to President Obama. I don't know why he had to step back. But if she leaves, in particular, someone has got to step up that he trusts, that he can confide in. And the other thing that she has that I only see on elite athletes, she acts the same under pressure as she does without pressure. I've seen her in the most chaotic situations. She's totally calm. GUILFOYLE: Very steady.KILMEADE: I thinking, maybe it's not that bad. Then I see her in the middle of the White House, everything is calm, she's the same way. I saw her after they won, day 3, absolutely calm. And she treats people with respect no matter how big your publication or your TV station is. I've witness it. That's also a rare commodity. Oh, excuse me, you're a local paper, I'm going to get out of the way. I'm going to the New York Times. That was never her attitude, nor did she like the spotlight. She was assistant to Ivanka. She didn't say to herself, if I'm assistant to Ivanka, someday I'll be in the White House. She had no interest in the paparazzi, in fame. She never sat for an interview. So the things that she has -- intangible qualities that I think is going to be impossible to replace, even though she's 28 without political experience. GUILFOYLE: She never made it about her. She was somebody that did not seek the attention or the limelight. In fact, she did not want to be press secretary. She didn't want the focus on her. She didn't want to be the person at the podium. She preferred to be strong and steady behind the scenes. I wish her the best. You can't imagine, you have to go testify and go through grueling. (CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: It's almost like all these pictures are from a photo shoot. She looks different. She's almost as if she is in a photo shoot. Every shot.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: . as if it's a contact sheet.WILLIAMS: You know, one thing I would say to you, Brian, is that given her age, she's 28-years-old as you point out, it's not as if she has any wealth of great experience to offer the president. It's the loyalty. It's the connection. She wouldn't have been there without President Trump. And there were questions when she was put in the position of being the communications director, could she handle it? It looks like she was handling it well enough, although the Trump White House as a torrent of news and controversy, if not chaos. PERINO: I think when you talk about her being calm it takes a tremendous amount of focused energy to be calm in all cases. And also, it is really important to have somebody in the White House who knows the president very well. So I will all just speak for George W. Bush. If you were to talk to Dan Bartlett, the first communications director for the president, he had to work for the president as an intern when he was in the governor's office, and then he worked his way up. He was on the campaign trail. He gets to the White House. They go through 9/11, and then they go through reelection in the whole Dan Rather thing. And you always knew -- if you couldn't get to the president, you could go to Dan and get advice and guidance. To have a presidential whisper like that it is very invaluable. I think President Trump will be able to find another one. I just knew there was going to possibly be trouble when they were on the plane, on Air Force One, coming back from Europe, and they edit the statement that Don Jr. gives about the meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian lady. Having been in an administration that had to deal with the special counsel in regards to things that were written and said on Air Force One, everyone that touch that has to go through the investigation. It is just excruciating. KILMEADE: If Mueller calls her, it's a $50,000 check, they say. PERINO: Really?KILMEADE: Immediately, you have to get a high-powered lawyer that's going to give you advise every step of the way. That's why, more than anything else, they fear that call. GUILFOYLE: All right, fascinating discussion. Thank you, A-blockers. We have a lot to get to still, including President Trump's meeting with lawmakers about gun control. Big news today. Plus, breaking new developments in the Parkland shooting investigation as well, why subpoenas were just issued to local police. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Students returned to Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida today, two weeks after the massacre that took the lives of 17. Today, we have breaking developments on the investigation. Florida's house has issued subpoenas to the Broward County sheriff's office, school board, and several local governments in its evaluation of what went wrong. Will Sheriff Israel released the surveillance video showing the police response to the mass shooting? A lot of controversy over that response. Meanwhile, over in our nation's capital, earlier, the president sat down with members of congress from both sides of the aisle to discuss changes to our nation's gun laws.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to come up with some ideas. Hopefully we can put those ideas in a very bipartisan bill. It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody could support. We have to do something very decisive. Number one, you can take the guns away immediately from people that you can judge easily are mentally ill. I don't want mentally ill people to be having guns. You know you rate movies for different things. Maybe you have to also rate them for terror, for what they're doing and what they're all about. Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified. They want to do what's right and they're going to do what's right. I really believe that.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly, so the president came up with some basic ideas like not selling guns to people under 21. He wants more of a universal, not quite -- better background checks. And then there's the question sitting out there about assault weapons. What do you think? GUILFOYLE: I think, you know, it makes sense. When you sit home and you listen to this and you think about the perspective of, you know, we would like some uniformity and conformity in terms of background checks. We would like all the states to have somewhat of a similar background check that is thorough, that's comprehensive and that people actually comply with that by turning in the information, updating the database to make sure that it is current and active. It really calls for that because it's so important in terms of a public safety perspective and to make sure that people, if they're troubled and they're having issues, that the most recent information is compiled and uploaded in the system to be available to law enforcement, to different agencies, to mental health care professionals to know who they're dealing with. I want that too. Wouldn't you want that? You want that kind of consistency across the board, so that if you go in to Alabama, it's not different, than say, if you go in to California. While at the same time, respecting the constitutional rights and the second amendment and people's right to bear arms, and part of that includes going through these checks. WILLIAMS: And Jesse, the president said today, he still likes the idea of arming teachers. And he said to the meeting, but understands a lot of you don't like that idea. And we just recently had a report of a teacher with a gun having a little incident -- I think it was in Georgia. So where do you think that stand? WATTERS: That's a tough one. I think there's a lot of disagreement on that issue and it depends where you are in the country. And people in Manhattan think that's wild. And then, you go out to anywhere else and they think, oh, yeah, that's normal. A lot of states already do it. There was a key moment I thought today where the president was kind of mocking Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania, about being beholden to the NRA, and they asked him about raising the age limit. And Toomey had a really great response, and he said, well, Mr. President, there's a lot of 18, 19 and 20- year-old men and women in my state of Pennsylvania that want to use an AR for fun, for target, for hunting. Why should we deny those law-abiding people their constitutional second amendment rights? And the president kind of setback and he said, all right -- he looked at Manchin and he said, yeah, you guys really have to get together on that because that's going to be a critical issue. On the Broward County thing, we're looking at information now from sources that said that the people that showed up, the police officers, were told not to go in unless they have body cameras, and none of them had body cameras. The EMT's that showed up were told not to go in. One of the EMT's told Fox News everything I was trained on mass casualty event said they did the wrong thing. Training since Columbine has been first responders. Police go in immediately with paramedics. So they had this de-escalation policy at the Broward County sheriff's department, and they had this other program called the promise program where they don't arrest students for criminal activity. And then, you get to the point where he appoints his friend to that position, and he was also involved in the Fort Lauderdale shooting at the airport which went horribly wrong, and he was castigated for that. Radio transmissions went down, the Fort Lauderdale shootings as well. Radio transmissions suspiciously went down in this shooting too. And now he's saying that they called the house 23 times, he responded. Turns out it was twice that. This guy, this sheriff is a real villain and I don't like what he's done and how he's conducted himself. And it looks like the Florida legislature is going to take some action against this guy. WILLIAMS: So there's a lot of stories in there, Jesse, but we've got to move on. But I just wanted to say to you, Dana, Dick's Sporting Goods has now come out and said they will not sell assault weapons. They're not going to sell any gun, hand gun, assault riffle, any guns to someone who is under 21, and they're not going to sell high-capacity magazines. PERINO: So it could be that this is a good PR move for them. But also, you are making a decision about selling a product. Maybe their sales weren't very good. Maybe it won't hurt them that bad on the bottomline. Maybe it will actually increase sales of people decide that might be a good place to go. If you don't mind, I just want to comment on these sessions that the president is having. There's something very special about them. Especially, when you think -- do you remember that open session that President Obama had on Obamacare early on, and Paul Ryan was there, and the president took a real shot at Paul Ryan.KILMEADE: Took a shot at McCain too.PERINO: . and McCain at the same event. And I just remember that was 2009, maybe early 2010, and it set bipartisan relations way back. And if it doesn't get back on track until there some moments where there's some crises on the budget where they have to get together. In this setting, the president is calling members of the senate by their first name, not disrespectfully, but in a way that is actually quite friendly. He's forcing people to come to the table. And it is not without risk to have open cameras there where anybody could come out and say anything. And I find that the members actually feel confident enough to say something in front of the president, in front of the cameras, that is not showboating. And I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen. If they continue to have these open forums and nothing results from them, then I think they'll get a little-bit old.KILMEADE: Right.PERINO: But right now it's very special.(CROSSTALK)KILMEADE: What's most important I think is the conclusion at the end. He says I like Manchin, Toomey. When Steve Scalise put his hand up and said I want to get concealed carry in that, he goes, Steve, I'm your biggest fan but that's never going to work, not on this bill. I will go back to that. And then, Dianne Feinstein, he goes, hey, can I get -- what was involved in that? He goes, guys, what do you think? They're like, I don't know. He goes, Mr. President, if you tell them, they'll do it, and they all left. To tell you the truth, this makes me realize if you could follow me on this, why ""The Apprentice"" worked, because the board room was actually real. That's the way he conducts his life. So they would edit that and do a good job on it, but for the most part those celebrities sat in front of him and they were the real people and he acts how he acts.GUILFOYLE: Imagine if he fires them.KILMEADE: So this communication team went a day over the last four days has sat all these people around him and said, Mr. Trump -- Mr. President, and he sat there. And I remember Joe Manchin said I don't like being senator because I really don't do anything. You can't get anything done. As governor, I got to do things. Now, he's in the game. He just said now, before we walk out, if he was president -- this was our president in 2013, we would have got stuff passed after Sandy Hook. That's a Democrat from West Virginia. I know he going to get reelected, but still it was unsolicited. WILLIAMS: Well, I think a lot of people would like to know the president position. But I hear what you're saying, this is the president's style to say, you guys, we want to get something done. PERINO: He's not a micromanager. WILLIAMS: Definitely not.PERINO: I think it probably will work better. WILLIAMS: Well, we'll see what happens. President Trump issuing more harsh words for his attorney general. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Another very public lashing today for Attorney General Jeff Sessions from his boss, President Trump. The president not pleased Sessions has enlisted the Justice Department's watchdog to investigation accusations of surveillance abuse on team Trump. He says it will take, quote, ""forever"" for the inspector general ""to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse"" and adds, ""Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers. DISGRACEFUL!""That comment got a direct response from Sessions hours later, quote, ""As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.""Brian, it wasn't just -- Michael Horowitz is the inspector general. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. He worked for both the Bush and the Obama administrations. And as far as I know, there is no other entity, unless they want to add another special counsel to their list of things they've got to worry about. KILMEADE: Right. A couple of things. The phones were down at the White House, obviously, and so were they down at the Department of Justice. Does anyone call each other anymore? Couldn't this have been handled with a phone call? And maybe the old-fashioned way, we call the NSA and say, ""Can we have that wiretap,"" and then it would play on the show, and ""The Five"" would be a better show. By the way, I'm in for Greg today. So the other thing I like to add is Michael Horowitz does have this great reputation, but he's got a full plate. And the one thing I would have to say, the president's right here. He'd be much better off letting the focus be not on the attorney general and on more friction but on that afternoon skull session with all those lawmakers. PERINO: Yes.KILMEADE: But Michael Horowitz has got a full plate. And he's about to come out in April, we believe, at the earliest with a look at about how this investigation was handled badly or on the positive side. PERINO: And on the -- well, also on the Clinton side.KILMEADE: And this gives him another major thing to do. So it's going to be a huge, major delay. PERINO: He also is doing the whole Clinton email investigation and looking at that. But he got a vote of confidence from a former attorney general, Michael Mukasey, today. But Kimberly, he got support from somebody like Mukasey, but Jerry Falwell, who supports the president, said that Sessions is actually -- probably pretended to be for Donald Trump and masked it, that he was actually a McCain and Bush guy and he was not a real -- and it seemed to me quite coordinated. GUILFOYLE: ""Days of Our Lives."" When soap stars talk to each other before the scene. Yes, it was quite funny. I was really interested from a legal perspective, from you know, Mukasey, because I like him. I've interviewed him. I've followed his career. I think he's well-reasoned. He's logical, and he is persuasive. The man knows what he's doing, and he's been able to kind of call it and get it right. So when you have that kind of level of support, that bodes well for Jeff Sessions. But I've got to tell you something: Jeff Sessions, he can take a punch. He's like unbelievable. Really. He's like a prizefighter. He says, ""OK, you might not like it too much, but I'm going to hang in there."" KILMEADE: Remember Reince Priebus had to plead with him, according to that story, to stay in the job. GUILFOYLE: I know. But look, he's still hanging in there.PERINO: It is interesting. Like if he -- I don't know whether -- it's weird, Juan. GUILFOYLE: They're frenemies?PERINO: Yes.WILLIAMS: I don't know. You know, I was talking to somebody about this today, and I was saying, ""Well, what's the president's strategy?"" Because he's sending a signal of discontent with his attorney general. And we know that last July, he said it was really ridiculous that Sessions had not -- had recused himself, because he said if he knew Sessions was going to recuse himself, he wouldn't have appointed him attorney general. PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: And then he's had these exchanges. And Brian just touched on the famous story that came from Reince Priebus where Sessions has some meeting with the president, decides he's going to quit, is told this. Priebus is told by Kelly, and then Priebus goes running out to the parking lot, gets in the car and tells him, ""You can't quit."" I don't know what the larger strategy is. What is his message?KILMEADE: I know what it is. It's Bill Parcells, George Steinbrenner. Same thing. He'll walk through the locker room, walk through, you know, go on the field, and he'll say, ""Hey, you going to get a hit one of these days? You going to catch a ball once in a while?"" He's pushing him to do better, and that's an aggressive -- Bill Parcells and Billy Martin. WILLIAMS: You think that -- that builds rapport?PERINO: This is a way of saying -- Jesse, if you are a president who likes loyalty, like you could -- Jeff Sessions was the first...WILLIAMS: Man.PERINO: ... who laid it all on the line for him. WATTERS: Yes, that's true, but the president doesn't feel like Sessions has had his back. He wished he had an attorney general like Eric Holder that had President Obama's back. I don't know if there is a strategy, Juan.GUILFOYLE: He had more than his back. It seems like.WATTERS: Yes, he has his back, he had his bottom; he had everything and even was held in contempt of Congress for protecting him. But I don't think there is a strategy. The president, the way he operates, he projects emotion and he projects energy into the world. And things kind of move around after he does that, and he kind of finds a way to kind of navigate through the chaos. And it's worked for him up unto this point. I understand his frustration. Because you have Hillary Clinton that literally colluded with the Russians. She paid a foreign agent...GUILFOYLE: There we go.WATTERS: ... to get Russian-sourced dirt. That's collusion. And then you have the Obama administration knowingly presenting unsubstantiated allegations, political opposition research from Russian sources to a FISA judge, and then deceiving the judge, not telling him it was paid for by Hillary. That's a felony. That's fraud. GUILFOYLE: That's...WATTERS: And then you have Peter Strzok, who hated this president so much at the FBI, he was the one that opened up an investigation into Papadopoulos.KILMEADE: Well, Michael Horowitz was the one who found Peter Strzok.WATTERS: And he was so biased, Mueller fired him from his team. He's looking at all these things and he's thinking, ""And I'm the one under investigation?"" Meanwhile, Obama didn't do anything to prevent the Russians from interfering. WILLIAMS: All right. Obama, Obama, the Clintons. PERINO: You two and your laundry list. WILLIAMS: I just want to rein you in...(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Instead of a monologue, ""Watter-logged.""WILLIAMS: I just want to rein you in and bring you back to what we were discussing.PERINO: We are all waterlogged. It's one way to get publicity for your candidacy. A proud pot smoker running for Congress lights up a joint in his new campaign ad. Coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Voters in the Chicago area don't have to wonder where one congressional candidate stands on the issue of pot legalization. Democrat Benjamin Thomas Wolfe could possibly be high in his new campaign ad that features him smoking a joint. GUILFOYLE: My God.WATTERS: Brian and the gang on ""FOX & Friends"" spoke with the cannabis candidate earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN THOMAS WOLFE (D), ILLINOIS CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: I think it's important that we -- that we actually start talking about legalizing cannabis. This is medicine for tens of millions of people in America. It can bring billions of dollars in tax revenue to Illinois. And really, it's -- it's the first component to completely overhauling and transitioning the criminal justice system here in America. KILMEADE: If you win, will you get high? WOLFE: Definitely. AINSLEY EARHARDT, CO-HOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": Oh, my gosh.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That's right, and...GUILFOYLE: She doesn't like him either.WATTERS: And Brian is going to be at the victory party, right along with him. So you know Chicago, his district that he's running for. Could this stunt win? KILMEADE: The average age is 35 years old. It's a very liberal area. I think absolutely will lock it in. They went heavily for Bernie Sanders. WATTERS: Really?KILMEADE: This guy -- this guy is going to waltz right into office. My feeling is...WATTERS: Wow.KILMEADE: ... On a serious note, if you look at everything with Illinois, I don't think pot should be the No. 1 issue. I mean, the way people are getting shot. The amount of -- what it takes to live a decent life in Chicago or around the city. Looking at the taxes.And the other thing is, I think it's a terrible message, in all seriousness. He comes out of the FBI and claims he started smoking pot when he left.PERINO: Yes, right. KILMEADE: Yes, right. That just happens.And that's the message? So the message is ""Everyone should get high. Vote for me"" I mean, that's good if you're in 11th grade trying to be senior class president. And still, the principal would come down on you.WATTERS: I want to ask the resident pothead at the table, Dana...PERINO: Yes, yes.WATTERS: ... who's very experienced in the ways of recreational marijuana. PERINO: Yes, yes, yes.WATTERS: Do you think this sends a bad message? Or is this -- you know, are people old enough to understand what's going on here? PERINO: Well, I guess to each his own. Except that I think that getting addicted to the tax revenue from this is a really bad way to fund your economy. Ask any of those states. In Colorado, they love the tax revenue that's come in, but they're -- these decisions are not without consequences. KILMEADE: They don't love the DUIs. PERINO: Well, yes.WATTERS: Are there a lot of problems? Are there a lot of problems in Colorado?PERINO: If I say that, I'm going to get a thousand emails saying that I'm wrong. And then there are studies that say, yes, they absolutely are. And emergency room visits up, things like that. Ask her. She's the other -- on the table.GUILFOYLE: Exactly. We're against all of it. KILMEADE: What's her name again?KILMEADE: We know why you're wearing green today, Kimberly. GUILFOYLE: Yes, because love of the Irish not for the marijuana. So I'm with Ainsley and Dana on this. You know, I just -- I saw too many things. And I saw young people really suffering...PERINO: Yes.GUILFOYLE: ... starting out using marijuana. I don't care if you send me 3 million emails, I will tell you what I think. I will tell you what I know. I don't care. I don't care.KILMEADE: I agree. What about...GUILFOYLE: I'm telling you, they do this. Then they're smoking marijuana. Then they're getting behind the wheel of a car. PERINO: Then they're eating all that snack food.GUILFOYLE: Then they're saying, ""Let's try something else."" Yes. Mama hides the snacks from the drawer. And then they start to develop kind of, like, this lifestyle. Right? And it becomes easier to try the next thing. All I'm saying is life is hard enough. Try to use some other coping mechanisms. And you know, try and...KILMEADE: Deep breathing, yoga? GUILFOYLE: Yes, try and not -- I mean, obviously people are suffering from cancer or need it for medicinal purposes, I totally understand that. But I think like anything, you shouldn't abuse it. You know, if you're going to try it, you know, just be careful.WATTERS: Yes. Juan uses pot to cope, right, Juan? WILLIAMS: Actually, Cheech, I use you. I talk to you. WATTERS: That's right.WILLIAMS: I get high by talking to you.But I mean, I think you guys are really out of touch with what's going on in the country on this. I think there's tremendous, tremendous momentum...PERINO: Happily so.WILLIAMS: ... for people legalizing the use of marijuana in state legislatures across the country. GUILFOYLE: I agree with that, yes. WILLIAMS: And I think the reason for this, by the way, is not some, you know, truant teenager who's saying, ""I want to smoke pot."" It's older people who are saying, ""You know what? I've enjoyed this my whole life, and it has medicinal purposes; and it also has good purposes in terms of relaxation and having a drink.""GUILFOYLE: I wasn't against that.WILLIAMS: I'm sorry. GUILFOYLE: I'm not against people who are elderly wanting it. KILMEADE: Is it responsible to use it in a campaign ad? That's my whole thing.GUILFOYLE: Yes.KILMEADE: You shouldn't sit there with beer or a bottle of whiskey and say, ""Vote for me."" WILLIAMS: Well, I think prohibition happened in this country. And guess what? People campaigned to end the ban on alcohol. WATTERS: And CNN did it on New Year's Eve, so I guess nothing matters any more.GUILFOYLE: You keep bringing that up. You're so mad.WATTERS: A lot of people would do anything to keep their pets forever. Barbra Streisand cloned hers, and it's creeping a lot of people out, like me. Next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KILMEADE: All right. Now it's time for some controversy 48 minutes into the show. As you know, we are big pet lovers on this cast, even when I fill in. Throughout this whole building. There are some amazing dogs in these families. We love them dearly, but would we, indeed, clone them after they reached their final destination, which we believe will be dog heaven? Barbra Streisand just revealed that she did. She cloned her dog, twos of her dogs, Miss Violet and Miss Scarlett, are clones of the late dog Samantha, who passed on last year, at about $50,000 a pop. Her third dog is a distant cousin, so they do have something in common. I go to Dana first, because she is the proud owner of, I believe the dog is Jasper...PERINO: America's dog.KILMEADE: ... America's dog, for her opinion. To clone a dog? PERINO: I am very much against this. KILMEADE: Why?PERINO: Although FiveFanPhotoshop said this is what my house would look like if I did clone Jasper.I -- you know I love my dogs. And Henry, this show had only been on air for six months when my previous dog died. And it was devastating. And the FOX family really helped me in order to get over it. I think it is selfish and wrong to think that you can clone another being. Because you could get another purebred that kind of looks like your previous dog. But you can't clone their hearts and their spirits. That's ridiculous.KILMEADE: I hear you have to cage the animal for a long time just for the cloning process, which is torturous. No. 2, Jesse, they're not the same dog. They just look the same. They don't act the same. WATTERS: How do you know they don't act the same, Brian? KILMEADE: Because they've already done a study of a few clones.WATTERS: I mean, come on. They look the same, they feel the same. It's the same dog. It's the same thing. Dog spirits? Right, the dog? Did you say they have a dog spirit? KILMEADE: Kimberly.WATTERS: I mean, they're animals. They're pets. They're animals. They look the same. You're never going to tell the difference.PERINO: You are wrong. WATTERS: I bet if they cloned Jasper, and they put Jasper and cloned Jasper next which other, you would not be able to tell the difference. KILMEADE: She would be able to tell.WATTERS: You would not be able to tell.KILMEADE: Kimberly, is this messing with nature? And do you feel bad for her husband? GUILFOYLE: Well, yes, for Babs' husband? Yes. It's quite interesting, isn't it? I don't know. I think it's a little bit -- kind of creepy. But they look pretty good. I think she got her money's worth. But I love our little dogs. You showed little pictures. These are Ronan's dogs, the Super Mario Brothers, Mario and Luigi, who are very, very, very, very cute. KILMEADE: Where are they? Can we see them?GUILFOYLE: Put them up. They were up earlier.KILMEADE: There you go. They don't look like clones.GUILFOYLE: Super Mario brothers. They're adorable. And they're quite mischievous. So not sure about cloning exactly. KILMEADE: Juan, Barbra Streisand says it is worth it to do this. PETA says it's not, and it should stop. Your reaction? WILLIAMS: I couldn't agree with PETA more. I mean, our shelters have too many stray dogs. KILMEADE: Thank you.WILLIAMS: I don't understand.PERINO: I can't believe she's not getting more crap about that.KILMEADE: Yes, why not? Come on, ""Funny Girl.""WILLIAMS: You know, the best part about this was it was an interview that she was doing with Variety, and it was supposedly about Hollywood and ""#MeToo."" And then she just mentions this, and everybody is like, ""This is more interesting."" And especially when she said, ""Send in the clones."" KILMEADE: Right. That is very funny.PERINO: Those viewers, if you think Jesse is wrong and that dogs do have personalities and spirits, please send him a text...KILMEADE: And tell him he's wrong. WATTERS: And also all those potheads that don't like Dana and what she said about your lovely weed in Colorado, email her. PERINO: It's on. KILMEADE: All right. I'm a -- as much as I like my dogs, I'm vehemently against cloning, especially because Barbra Streisand did it. GUILFOYLE: Yes.KILMEADE: That's my problem. When we come back, we have ""One More Thing."" Don't ask me how I know. GUILFOYLE: Not a good representative.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: It's time now for ""One More Thing"". Wow, regal in green. Killing it today. All right. Oh, ""Royal News."" I got too carried away with the crown.This is super exciting, folks. This year's royal wedding is already set to be the event of the year. But you're not going to even believe this. They just upped the ante, went all the way over the top. Brian, stop fidgeting, please.KILMEADE: Sorry. GUILFOYLE: Mel B, former known as Scary Spice, just let it slip that the iconic girl group has been invited to the wedding of Prince Harry to actress Meghan Markle. How fab is that? So then she drops the heavy hint that she and the Spice Girls will be reuniting for a performance at the royal wedding reception. I mean, can you even imagine?PERINO: No. I am not for that.GUILFOYLE: Yours will be, like, Dierks Bentley. Different traits. Royal segment, would be a country segment.So fans have been totally buzzing about this. They're super excited and everyone really wants to get an invitation. And especially because Victoria Beckham shared a group photo of the ladies having lunch together recently. So it looks like our ""Spice World"" dreams are finally coming true. Dana.PERINO: You should get an invitation to the wedding. GUILFOYLE: I mean, really.PERINO: You have done a lot of P.R. for them. GUILFOYLE: Yes, I'm really helping the royal family a lot. PERINO: I want to talk about somebody that was a really lovely man, and he died yesterday. His name was William Buckey Bush. He died at the age of 79 in West Palm Beach. He was the youngest brother of former president George H.W. Bush. He graduated from Yale. He was the CEO of Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis from 1978 to '86. He was also a very devoted Cardinals fan. His wife Patricia passed in 2015. He is survived by his two children. And he was loved by everyone, including George W. Bush, the former president, and certainly by his brother, 41. Rest in peace. GUILFOYLE: God bless them. That's a tough loss for the family. Very beloved.OK, Jesse.WATTERS: OK, this ""One More Thing"" is called look before you leap. Check this video out. A deer running through the streets of Louisville, Kentucky. There it goes, just bouncing around. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(DEER JUMPS OVER FENCE AND LANDS IN CREEK)(END VIDEO CLIP)KILMEADE: Oh, wow. WATTERS: And into the water. Deer can swim, Brian. Little-known fact. So all the producers are, like, freaking out about, you know, is the deer were OK? Did the deer die? GUILFOYLE: You'll get emails.KILMEADE: I almost had a deer.WATTERS: It's a deer. It's an animal. PERINO: It has a spirit.WATTERS: They can swim. They can swim. KILMEADE: Right.WATTERS: The deer are fine. I don't even know if it's fine, but it's obviously fine.PERINO: How scary. The poor thing. GUILFOYLE: No, we get emails. People get mad. WATTERS: Really?GUILFOYLE: Like, what happened? You don't care about the animals. WATTERS: People get mad at Juan. People don't get mad at me. KILMEADE: Nobody cares about you. GUILFOYLE: So sad. And Rudolph did so much.KILMEADE: They did. And it was foggy that night. GUILFOYLE: All right. All right, ""FOX & Friends."" Let's go, Juan. WILLIAMS: OK, so a journey through grandma's papers can be a journey through American history. That's what happened to Michael O'Mara (ph) of Houston. After his mom died in 2014, he found a rare handmade copy of the Declaration of Independence. PERINO: Wow.WILLIAMS: Only 200 copies were made in 1820. Today only 51 are known to be in existence. O'Mara's (ph) mother is a descendant of President James Madison's favorite nephew. And the president gave the young man his copy.PERINO: Wow.WILLIAMS: And apparently, it stayed in the family. Now it's been sold for more than a million dollars. The philanthropist David Rubenstein, who already owns four of the remaining copies. PERINO: Good for him. WATTERS: I'm going to tear up my attic up tonight. There's got to be something in there. PERINO: Maybe you can find your Matchbox cars.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: We know a girl.WATTERS: ... parents.GUILFOYLE: I like it, too.Brian.KILMEADE: All right. You guys got a chance to see me in person. Now it's time for the people in New Jersey. And Georgia. They have the same thing. I'll be signing George -- ""Andrew Jackson: The Miracle of New Orleans"" on Books and Greetings. That will be in New Jersey on Thursday. And then on Friday, over to Georgia, see my WSV (ph) listeners. And at Barnes & Noble there in Marietta at 7 p.m. on Friday night and then back Saturday to enjoy my weekend in my shorts. Now, attention people next generation, there's something extremely disturbing about iPads and iPhones. Kids no longer have the muscles in their hands...PERINO: Right.KILMEADE: ... to use pencils and pens. This is a widespread global problem. Kids can't write, because they don't have the muscles. How weak are we as humans? GUILFOYLE: They need occupational therapy. PERINO: They need to play with blocks so that they can have grips.KILMEADE: Or write once in a while. GUILFOYLE: I don't know what's up with that chair that people think they get two ""One More Things.""Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of ""The Five."" Move it. ""Special Report"" up next.

Not signed up yet? Click here.Developing now, Tuesday, Feb. 20 2018THE LEAD STORY - GOP LAWMAKERS FACING PRESSURE TO ACT ON GUN CONTROL AS FLORIDA SCHOOL LOOKS TO MOVE FORWARD: A hundred Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School students are busing 400 miles to Florida's capital Tuesday to urge lawmakers to act to prevent a repeat of the massacre that killed 17 of its students and faculty last week ... The students plan to hold a rally Wednesday in hopes that it will put pressure on the state's Republican-controlled Legislature to consider a sweeping package of gun-control laws. However, this time, a combination of pressure from the public and President Trump could spur at least some changes in the country's gun laws. The White House has said Trump backs efforts to improve the country's background check system. His involvement could be the nudge for action in a Congress divided on virtually every issue. As lawmakers grapple with a plan of action, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School plans to reopen in phases starting this Friday. OBAMA UNDER THE MICROSCOPE ON RUSSIA: President Trump on Monday followed other Republican leaders in questioning why the Obama administration failed to act” on the intelligence that Russia’s meddling in U.S. politics began in 2014 ... “Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?” Trump tweeted. Last week, a federal grand jury, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia collusion probe, indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election.TRUMP-ROMNEY FEUD OVER ... UNTIL NEXT TIME?: President Trump gave his full backing to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Monday, saying Romney's bid for a Senate seat from Utah ""has my full support and endorsement!"" ... The president's tweet suggested he may have buried the hatchet, at least temporarily, with the GOP foe who called Trump a ""phony"" and a ""fraud"" in 2016. Trump wrote Monday evening that Romney ""will make a great Senator and worthy successor"" to the retiring Orrin Hatch.GOLD - OR THE GULAG: As North Koreans return home this week from the Pyeongchang Winter Games, possibly without any medals, Olympians hope to avoid the gulags — a fate the losers of the 1966 World Cup are believed to have experienced ... Twenty-two North Koreans participated in the 2018 Olympics, with the support of the nation’s handpicked cheering squad, for the regime’s ninth representation in a Winter Games. Competing in figure skating, skiing and ice hockey — as part of a joint team with South Korea — the country has failed to medal in any event, surely disappointing leader Kim Jong Un, whose family allegedly sentenced the failed World Cup athletes to concentration camps for the loss. AS SEEN ON FOX NEWSTHE TRUMP HATERS CLUB: ""So much of the opposition media is part of their own 4-H club."" – Michelle Malkin, on ""Hannity,"" likening the press to an anti-Trump ""club"" that cares only about ""bringing down the president.""

16,"Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, says it would be a mistake for CPAC to back away from conservations around the Second Amendment.With the gun control debate heating up in Washington in the wake of the Parkland shooting, the CEO of the National Rifle Association is keeping details about his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference under wraps – apparently as a precaution. A spokesman for the NRA confirmed to Fox News that Wayne LaPierre will speak at the conservative conference, which kicked off Wednesday outside Washington. But unlike for other speakers, information about his appearance was not publicly released.A time for the speech has not been finalized, the spokesman said. The Washington Examiner reported that his name is deliberately being kept off the schedule as a precaution due to possible outrage from anti-gun protesters in the wake of the shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.A related panel discussion was also left off the schedule.""Wayne LaPierre will be speaking, he's my friend, he's a leader in this area, and I'm glad he's going to be there,"" Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union which is heading up CPAC, said on Fox News' ""The Daily Briefing.""The shooting has re-ignited the long-running debate over the Second Amendment and gun control laws. President Trump announced late Tuesday that he has ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft new regulations to ban firearm modifiers like the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas shooting in October.TRUMP CONSIDERS RAISING PURCHASE AGE FOR CERTAIN FIREARMS, AMID GUN CONTROL TALKSA White House source told Fox News on Wednesday that Trump is open to a number of measures to address mass shootings, including a rise in the minimum age for owning certain firearms -- proposals likely to see some resistance from the NRA and other gun-rights groups.LaPierre, and other high-profile pro-Second Amendment speakers such as Dana Loesch, will be closely watched to see how they respond to the proposals from the White House.Trump himself will speak Friday and it is unclear if he will address calls for new gun legislation, and how that will be received.The prominence of the gun debate will also tap into a tension between more traditional conservatives -- who consider Second Amendment protections paramount -- and nationalist-populists more focused on immigration and Islamism.Targeting the latter wing is the appearance scheduled for Thursday by right-wing French former lawmaker Marion Maréchal-Le Pen -- the niece of 2017 French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and the granddaughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen.Marion Maréchal-Le Pen will speak at CPAC.
								
									 (Reuters)
The 28-year-old Marion is widely viewed as more conservative than her aunt Marine -- who worked to distance herself and “de-toxify” her party of the racist and anti-Semitic views of her father Jean-Marie, who was convicted and fined for comments in which he called the Holocaust a ""detail of history."" Marine made it to the run-off in 2017 where she lost to now-President Emmanuel Macron.While both share hardline views on issues such as Islam and immigration, Marion has expressed more traditionally conservative views on issues such as gay marriage and abortion. According to French newspaper L’Incorrect, Le Pen’s theme at CPAC will be ""conservativism on both shores.""Schlapp defended the invite in the face of criticism from conservatives.""She's her own person, she's a young person, she's broken with her family on those positons and she's a new voice in France and by the way she's a voice that resembles a lot of conservative voices here,"" he said on ""The Daily Briefing."" ""She's for traditional marriage, she's pro-life, she doesn't believe that the welfare state solves problems and, yes, she wants to make sure when people immigrate into France that they want to be French and love the country.""National Review’s Jonah Goldberg was unconvinced, calling the move a “bad decision” and asking whether she was a classical liberal or a “National Front Kardashian with better messaging?”But you said she's a ""classical liberal"" and I took you at your word. Is that true? Or is she a National Front Kardashian with better messaging?The tension hits at the center of the debate within conservative circles over whether the GOP should stick to its free-market Reaganite conservatism or lean toward the more European-style nationalist-populist movements -- reflected in the 2016 candidacy of Donald Trump. CPAC generally has tilted toward the former, and has had a sometimes-rocky relationship with populist speakers and lawmakers. Trump pulled out of a planned appearance there in 2016 over concerns of a backlash from more traditional conservatives.With Trump now president, there is evidence of more populism seeping into CPAC. Former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage will speak, as will former Trump adviser and Fox News contributor Sebastian Gorka -- both of whom have called for restriction of immigration and warned against the dangers of Islamism.Fox News' Alex Pappas and John Roberts contributed to this report.Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

All of these protesters, all of the people taking to the street said that was not the main purpose, but yet it has come up because former Supreme Court justice Stevens, John Paul Stevens, writing an op-ed in ""The New York Times"" ""In 2008, the Supreme Court overturned Chief Justice Burger's long settled understanding of the Second Amendment's limited reach by the ruling in District of Columbia versus Heller that there was an individual right to bear arms. That decision, which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable, has provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power. Overturning that decision via constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymy legislative debate and to block constructive gun-control legislation than any other available option.""

I think Justice Stevens got a little too use to only having to get five votes on the Supreme Court. Obviously repealing an amendment and repealing one that is as beloved in many states in the union as this one would require super majorities of the states to sign on. It's an impossible task. And for that matter, even getting some of the proposals that have been put forward by these groups that want gun-control, they are nowhere near it, as Dianne Feinstein has intimated in the Senate. Last time they tried to do it, they would have been lucky to have gotten 40 votes. So in that way, not much has changed politically in Washington. BAIER: So Catherine, does this hurt somehow the effort that we just saw with the past few days that now this left, liberal justice who, by the way, was appointed and nominated by a Republican, is suggesting get rid of the Second Amendment? CATHERINE LUCEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think what we need to note is that none -- we haven't heard from organizers of the march or the leaders on this issue really backing this idea. I looked a little bit on Twitter to see who is getting on board, and one of the students who was a key member of the march organizers, he tweeted today that this wasn't something that he was looking for. So it's clear that there are people trying to put some distance between themselves and this statement. That said, it does play into this argument you will hear from gun owners and the National Rifle Association, this anxiety that the real agenda from some of these gun-control advocates is to really try and repeal the Second Amendment. BAIER: Yes, Buck. BUCK SEXTON, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: I have to say that there is a continued anxiety because we keep seeing instances like this with very prominent voices from the left or from the Democrat Party who say what we all think they actually believe which is that they would like there to be if not an outright ban, something very close to a ban on firearms in private hands of all kind. Quite honestly, it's also the only intellectually consistent argument. We often hear about incremental changes, people will talk about common sense gun reforms. And then there won't be a consensus on what those reforms would be, Bret. If they are so obvious and so common sense, one would think they could all get on the same sheet of music. I walked through one of these protest marches in New York over the weekend, and there were signs about banning AR-15s. There was a sign I saw that said ""Trump kills kids."" So the rhetoric is clearly way out of line and overheated. And I would just also note that that New York Times editorial from a former Supreme Court justice, they misidentified the picture of a weapon at the very top of the editorial as a rifle when it was in fact a musket, which for those of us who watch the debate closely is not surprising from the New York Times. BAIER: Here is some of the sound of a president bringing up the Second Amendment as we've heard over recent weeks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They will take away your Second Amendment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are not trying to take everybody's guns away. And the NRA wants people to think that. They're fearmongers. TRUMP: There is nobody that loves the Second Amendment more than I do. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I think of all these young people, these leaders, are making it very clear it's a false choice to suggest you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. (END VIDEO CLIPS)BAIER: So Kimberley, is there a way to get the debate to a place where something actually happens in Congress? STRASSEL: In the short-term, no. And I think that that's the important thing for everyone to understand. In Congress, despite everyone talking about how these marchers signal some new front and some new change in the politics, the reality is in Washington this is probably the most pro-Second Amendment Republican Congress potentially in history. Nobody is going on the road of assault weapons bans. They passed the Fix NICS bill as part of the omnibus which does sure up some things in our background system. Many of them feel confident that that does provide them a way of saying they are doing something about this issue. But they are not going to take up any legislation on this. The question is whether or not this plays some way in the midterms in the fall. Whether or not it potentially hurts Senate Democrats up for reelection in Trump states or whether it potentially hurts Republicans who are in suburban districts where there may be a lot of women voters or others who are watching this and they are not as committed to Second Amendment issues. We just won't know that until November comes along. BAIER: How many times, Catherine, do you think we will hear do you agree with Justice John Paul Stevens? LUCEY: I'm sure that's going to be a talking point going forward, absolutely. But yet, I think to Kimberley's point, in the short term we are not likely to see sweeping change. The omnibus had some incremental changes. And there's really no momentum right now for any kind of big major gun belt.Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

20,"Singer Kaya Jones and 'The Five' co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle weigh in on 'Hannity' Chrystal Neria, whose stage name is Kaya Jones, shared some pretty frank thoughts about the gun control debate with her followers on Twitter during the National School Walkout protests.Jones, best known for her work performing with the Pussycat Dolls, has been a solo act since 2004. In 2017, she joined the National Diversity Coalition for Trump as its Native American Ambassador. Her public persona isn’t shy about voicing her conservative beliefs, which she did in a series of posts on Wednesday in reaction to the walkout.They have their right to walk out & I have my right to bear arms. I’m not giving up my rights because a crazy man killed people.I’m holding on right to my rights so if a crazy man tries to kill me he’s got another thing coming. It’s called freedom. #2ADefenders #2A #2ndAmendment https://t.co/PVixWl3wTU“They have their right to walk out & I have my right to bear arms. I’m not giving up my rights because a crazy man killed people. I’m holding on right to my rights so if a crazy man tries to kill me he’s got another thing coming. It’s called freedom,” she said in response to a post about the protests.Two hours later, she continued her Twitter rant, this time going after the argument that gun advocates don’t care about children.This whole walk out on guns is a joke. You realize that in order to protect kids we need guns. The signs that read protect kids not guns are so unaware. You need a gun to fight a gun. It’s not a want it’s a fact.

It’s therapeutic and empowering to know how to fight back. It’s better to have, and not need, than to need, and not have. #ItsCalledFreedom“If you’ve ever been attacked in your life and didn’t want to learn everything about attackers or weapons you are being foolish.

25,"Greg Abbott says Texas mourns for the victims of this 'heinous' act, praises the actions of first responders, says he will convene roundtable discussions to create laws to protect the community.Following last week's deadly shooting at a high school near Houston that left 10 people dead, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday that he could support some gun control measures.The move is something of a change of heart for Abbott, a Republican who has worked to expand gun rights in Texas.Earlier this year, Abbott had backed President Donald Trump's proposal to arm more teachers in lieu of sweeping gun control measures, saying that almost 20 percent of Texas schools already have trained and armed educators. “When a shooting takes place, people want to rush to simple solutions,” Abbott said in February, after a mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17. “It’s time to tackle the tough solutions, and that’s mental health.”On Wednesday, Abbott said he could back stronger regulations for gun storage and quicker reporting to law enforcement when a court has determined someone is mentally ill -- in order to keep that person from having weapons.The Texas governor said those were top considerations to emerge after meeting representatives of a gun control group and gun owners as well as mental health and education experts in discussions on school safety.""This conversation is a long time in coming."" ""We have one goal ... making sure we're going to keep to our students, our schools, our communities safer,"" without limiting the right to bear arms, Abbott said.Abbott called for the meetings as he weighs ideas for possible legislative action or executive orders. Tuesday focused on mental health issues.Thursday's meeting will include students and families from the shooting at Santa Fe High School and the November 2017 attack on a rural church in Sutherland Springs, as well as Stephen Willeford, the armed ""good Samaritan"" who shot back at the church shooter.TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTER'S FATHER SAYS BULLYING MAY HAVE CAUSED RAMPAGEThe governor has said he wants to keep guns away from people ""who would try to murder our children."" But critics have said Texas isn't serious about changing its gun-loving culture.A group of student activists wrote the governor a letter Wednesday, criticizing his support of the National Rifle Association and calling for expanded background checks on gun purchases and other gun-control measures.""We are dying on your watch. What will you do about it?"" said the letter signed by students who identified themselves as organizers of Texas student gun-control marches held after the February shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Two children look at a memorial for the Santa Fe High School shooting victims outside the school Wednesday, May 23, 2018, in Santa Fe, Texas. 
								
									 (AP)
Wednesday's three-hour discussion included representatives of Texas Gun Sense, which has pressed for tougher background checks for gun sales and ""red flag"" laws that keep guns away from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.Ed Scruggs, vice chairman of Texas Gun Sense, said he was glad to get a seat at the table.""This conversation is a long time in coming. We needed it and it kind of releases the tension a little bit,"" said Ed Scruggs, vice chairman of Texas Gun Sense. ""You get a sense everyone does care.""TOMI LAHREN: 'KNEE-JERK REACTIONS' ON GUN CONTOL ARE 'NEVER THE SOLUTION'Police have said the 17-year-old suspect in the Santa Fe shooting used his father's shotgun and .38-caliber handgun. Abbott said he and lawmakers need to look at how to address gun storage laws that might have prevented the shooter from getting the weapons.Texas allows authorities to deny handgun licenses based on a person's mental health history and to seize weapons from people determined to be in a mental crisis in some circumstances. But mental health history information is up to the applicant to provide and is not related to the purchase of a gun.Texas courts are supposed to tell law enforcement if a person taken in for a mental health evaluation has been ordered into a mental hospital. Weapons seized could be returned to that person's family. Abbott said that reporting could take up to 30 days and he'd like to see that window closed to within 48 hours or less.""That is incomprehensible, especially given technology today,"" Abbott said.Federal law prohibits an individual ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" or involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility from owning or purchasing a firearm.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

26,"The debate hits close to home with members of both parties nearly killed six years apart; Mike Emanuel has the story for 'Special Report.'Editor's note: The following column first appeared in The Washington Times.As the nation continues to reel from the nation’s worst mass shooting in modern history, politicians and other opportunists find the massacre too inviting not to exploit. The knee-jerk cravenness of liberals to scrape up their calls for gun-control while demonizing the National Rifle Association (NRA) immediately sucks all the air out of the room, eliminating any discussion or investigation of other foundational forces driving mass violence.At about 7:03 a.m. EDT, as the East Coast was waking up to the horrific news of the shooting in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton was ready at the smartphone. With little information and even less decency, she reduced the unfolding human catastrophe to a political opportunity: “The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.”Continuing the missives to her 18.7 million Twitter followers, she actually managed to insist we put politics aside while doing the opposite, all within the 140-character limit, “Our grief isn’t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.”The left’s obsession with gun control has never been well-received by Americans who also want the carnage to stop. One reason is real-life experience with the failure of banning an object instead of addressing the human condition, what drives an individual to resort to such obscene behavior.Mrs. Clinton’s ghoulish instinct was true to form as liberal strategy unabashedly made clear by Rahm Emanuel in November 2008, as chief of staff for President-elect Obama. He told The Wall Street Journal, “You never want to let a serious crisis go to waste, and what I mean by that is it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”Mrs. Clinton was roundly criticized for her comments, which were made hours before the bodies of the murdered had been collected from the ground on which they fell.This nation knows well the arguments about gun control, as we have experienced mass shootings, too many and too often. We also know the left’s obsession with gun control has never been well-received by Americans who also want the carnage to stop. Why? There are the important arguments about that pesky thing called the Constitution and the Second Amendment, but we also have real-life experience with the failure of banning an object instead of addressing the human condition, and what drives an individual to resort to such obscene and inhuman behavior.For liberals, this obsession with gun control reverses any progress we could make as it’s seen as “the solution” when nothing could be further from the truth. Chicago experiences massacres every weekend despite (and some would argue, because of) having some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.For the first weekend of October, the Chicago Tribune reported, “At least 32 people were shot over the weekend, including a man killed along the Chicago River on the Northwest Side and a 13-year-old boy wounded while riding his bike in Little Village on the West Side, according to police. Between Friday afternoon and early Monday, at least four people were killed and 28 others wounded, police said.”The prior weekend in the Windy City brought a grim milestone of 500 homicides, so far, for 2017.For some reason, Mrs. Clinton and the other liberals and Hollywood celebrities tweeting their outrage and demands for gun control have been silent about the massacres in Chicago. Perhaps because they were successful there and “gun control” was achieved. Now that it failed, they would have to confront issues like gangs, MS-13 and drugs. Confronted with the fraud of the liberal solution of gun control, the only answer is to not look, move on and abandon the victims.Now with President Trump at the helm, we are beginning to address gang issues, including the scourge of illegal alien gangs like MS-13. Even more significant is the crackdown on the opioid crisis. After years of increasing addiction to prescription painkillers, we are only now beginning to intervene.We still don’t know what factors drove Stephen Paddock to meticulously plan a mass murder that killed, at this writing, 59 people and wounded 527. We search for something that will shed light on the maniac’s reasoning, so it will “make sense.” While psychotropics help innumerable people around the world, rarely is there any transparency about or investigation into mind-altering prescription drug use and its possible impact on perpetrators of mass violence.The Mayo Clinic warns, “Nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug, and more than half take two.” Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center researchers say, “Antibiotics, antidepressants and painkilling opioids are most commonly prescribed.”In the case of transnational mass-murdering ISIS, their terrorists are fed a drug called Captagon, known as the “jihad pill,” Newsweek reported. Captagon is an amphetamine-based drug banned throughout the world in the 1980s.Despite the worldwide ban, the drug “remains popular in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where more Captagon is consumed than in any other country in the world,” Newsweek noted.Many commentators and experts this week have warned us the Las Vegas massacre is the “new normal.” It doesn’t have to be, any more than ISIS has to be. We know we can only defeat Islamic terrorism by being honest about the enemy, in all its human complexity. We must demand the same clarity here at home.Tammy Bruce is a radio talk-show host, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News political contributor.",0
27,"Congress turns its attention to gun violence following Florida school shooting; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel.This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" February 19, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.: We have to make it harder for people to be able to purchase weapons. We have people know who are on terrorist watchlists who can purchase a weapon. SEN. JAMES LANKFORD, R-OKLA.: I have no issue with more extensive background checks. I have no issue with slowing down purchase for people who show all the basic warning signs. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: We are going to make school safety the top priority. We're also going to work with the Congress and leaders around the country to more effectively give law enforcement tools to deal with people suffering with dangerous mental illness. (END VIDEO CLIPS)JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS: Political leaders way in in the wake of 17 students being gunned down in Parkland, Florida, in that latest school shooting, one of the worst that we have seen in this country.Let's bring in our panel now to talk about where we go from here: Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and publisher; Anne Gearan, political correspondent at The Washington Post, and Mollie Hemingway, the senior editor at The Federalist.So we have now Republicans saying something needs to change. We need to do something in the wake of this. But we heard similar language after the Las Vegas shooting in which Republicans seem to support this idea of banning these bump stocks. So Anne, are we getting close to critical mass that something will happen? Or will be talked about and like we have seen in the past it will fade away? ANNE GEARAN, THE WASHINGTON POST: Certainly history suggests that there will be a moment here like there was with bump stocks, and then it will go away. That said, I think this really does feel like there is a different current in the water. And I think we see evidence that President Trump feels there is something different about this time too. The main difference to me I think is these kids. It is really hard to look away and really hard to ignore 17, 18-year-olds who are blaming adults, blaming the president, blaming the political system, blaming both parties for not doing enough. And if that level of action and political engagement continues, it's going to be hard for everyone to look away. ROBERTS: Tom, can these students go up against the entrenched beliefs on both sides of the aisle here in Washington? TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: They can. I think as Anne said, they are pretty effective communicators for their cause. The problem is with these instants we always see in hindsight what we should've seen in foresight. And you can go back. The interesting fact, John, the last three mass shootings in Florida, Omar Mateen, Pulse Nightclub, June, 2016, Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in January, 2017, and this one, all three perpetrators were on the radar of the FBI. In fact, the one who shot up the Fort Worth airport went into the FBI office and said he was being mind- controlled by the CIA, said all these crazy things, and still managed to get a gun, go down there and do this. So the FBI think I think really did drop the ball not just in this incident but in others. And that's part of the problem. We have the dots. They are all there, we are just not able to connect them. ROBERTS: Mollie, one of the big questions is where does President Trump come down all this and what is the appropriate role that he should take on? Let's listen to what the Ohio governor John Kasich said he thinks the president should do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO: We need leadership out of the executive. This is a great opportunity for common sense steps that can be taken just in the area of background checks. Of course the president can lead on this and should lead on this. (END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: So the president supports enhanced background checks, but really what he is supporting is to enforce the laws that are already on the books to make sure the federal government and the states report to this NICS criminal background check database which they are not doing now. So how much leadership are we going to see out of the president? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: People do seem to want government action at times like this, and if they do care about government action, there are all these opportunities as Tom pointed out with the Florida examples. But also this is the third shooting I can think of where there was specific government failure. The Charleston church shooting, the Texas church shooting, there was failure to put people on the list that would make it so that they would be caught during a background check.Here you had multiple people giving specific, credible assessments that this guy was going to do exactly what he did. Rather than put new laws on the books that are not followed I think a great thing for the government to do would actually be to make sure that the laws that are on the books, the guidance that is on the books is faithfully executed rather than have another thing that isn't followed. ROBERTS: It seems like a simple thing. Here's the law, here's what the law stipulated. Everybody, let's get together and make sure that we are faithfully adhering to the laws and we're sharing all of this information. Seems like a no-brainer to me. GEARAN: The NICS system does have one soft spot which is that states are not compelled to turn over the information. And what the Cornyn-Murphy bill would do is add incentives and encouragement to states to do that so you would have a better collection of information. But in this particular instance, if the FBI had followed up, if a number of other potential fail-safes which are not actually a law had been in place, this guy might've been stopped. But there is one law that would have prevented at least him doing exactly what he ended up carrying out, which is an assault weapon ban. He was able to legally buy an AR-15 which would not have been the case 15 years ago. And so that is a high hurdle for Congress to consider taking up the assault weapons ban again, but certainly you're going to hear calls for it. ROBERTS: So the FBI, as you pointed out, Tom, is being called out for missing a very big warning signal here in failing to connect the dots. Ohio Governor John Kasich said people should be held accountable for that. What should happen in your estimation if the FBI is told at it's headquarters that there is a credible threat against a school in Florida and never passes that information along to the local field office? BEVAN: Somebody should be suspended or lose their job. ROBERTS: Should that be the FBI director? BEVAN: Oh, I don't know that it necessarily has to be the FBI director, but certainly the people who fielded that information and failed to pass it on as was part of FBI protocol. They did not follow FBI protocol. There should be consequences for that. I think The FBI could actually undertake a broader investigation about the cases that I mentioned and others. Why they are not able to connect the dots, why the are not able when they have people who have all these red flags and warning signs. Omar Mateen was on a terrorist watch list for two years. They interviewed him, closed the case, took him off there, and he managed to commit the crime. So the FBI can do a lot of internal investigation and perhaps come up with some ways of doing things better in the future to try and prevent these things from happening, because they keep happening. ROBERTS: All right, we'll leave this discussion there. A lot more to talk about. Next up, the Russia indictments suggest how vulnerable are this year's midterm elections to interference.Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

At a weekend candidate forum Wexton was criticized for voting for legislation that expanded concealed-carry rights, with Davis Stover saying the vote was ""reckless and shows bad judgment,"" according to the Washington Post.Davis Stover has been endorsed as the ""gun sense candidate"" in the primary by Moms Demand Action, a badge of honor she currently has pinned to the top of her Twitter account. She recently toldPolitico that she viewed the NRA's support for Rep. Barbara Comstock—the Republican she hopes to be on the ballot against in November—as a vulnerability.Davis Stover, however, hasn't always viewed the NRA as toxic.Davis Stover was previously chief of staff for former representative Chet Edwards, a Texas Democrat who separated himself from his party when it came to gun rights. She took time away from his official office in 2010 to work on his reelection campaign, which was endorsed by the NRA.Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon. ",0

31,"NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch reacts to Trump's bipartisan gun reform talks, slams gun control proposals such as raising age restrictions on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.'This is a rush transcript from ""The Story,"" February 28, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening, Bret, thank you.  Breaking tonight, new information about the departure of Hope Hicks and what it may signal about the power struggle within the White House. Big questions about why the announcement came today, just one day after she testified for nine hours before the House Intel Committee on the Russia investigation. The 29-year-old was perhaps the most important person on the campaign and in the White House when it came to access to the president. She was loyal, professional, and basically understood the president like a family member. David Bossie, Trump's 2016 Deputy Campaign Manager, joins me in just a moment with his thoughts on this very surprising news today. But we begin with Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry, live at the White House with all of the breaking news tonight. Good evening, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you, Martha. I mean, the day began around here with a little bit of chaos about the president again beating up on the man that he has called his beleaguered attorney general. That overshadowed, just a few hours later, by this abrupt and unexpected exit by the Communications Director Hope Hicks. As you mentioned, she's only 29, and yet had become very effective, influential in the West Wing. The president's longest serving aide who got high marks for helping shepherd the tax cut messaging, which is why her exit statement focuses on how, in her words, there are no words to adequately express her gratitude to the president. The president glowing in his statement praising her three years at his side dating back to the campaign, 'she as thought smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. I will miss having her by my side. But when she approached about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood.  I'm sure we will work together again in the future.' That from the president. But remember, Hicks received negative publicity when her boyfriend at the time White House aide, Rob Porter, left after accusations he had abused two ex-wives. Then yesterday, Hicks spent several hours testifying before the House Intelligence Committee about Russia, and took heat today after it was revealed that among other things, she told lawmakers she told little white lies for the president. Nonetheless, top advisors tell me this abrupt exit has nothing to do with yesterday's testimony and that she had recently signaled she'd be leaving soon. Instead, senior advisors to the president tell me the real story here is Chief of Staff John Kelly trying to consolidate power, even though Kelly did put out a statement declaring Hicks 'has served her country with great distinction'. Remember, this comes amid indications Kelly may also be trying to ease out senior advisor, the presidential son in law, Jared Kushner. After a series of leaks around here, about his security clearance troubles. In fact, Bloomberg has a breaking story tonight that more than 30 White House staffers have been stripped of their top-secret clearance. Meanwhile, more drama as we noted, surrounding Jeff Sessions. Yesterday, he said, he's going to have the inspector general at Justice, probe allegations that Obama officials improperly approved surveillance of a former Trump advisor. Well, the president tweeted today: 'Why is A.G. Sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse? Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power, and already late with reports on Comey, et cetera? Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? Disgraceful.' Well, that Inspector General Michael Horowitz was nominated to this post by Barack Obama, but he was appointed to a previous federal post by a Republican president and our own Brit Hume tweeted today, 'This is Trump at his worst. He's asking that the DOJ investigate itself. The inspector general, who has his own staff of lawyers and investigators, at least enjoys a measure of independence from the department. Trump still wants the A.G. to act as his political goalie.' Now, Sessions pushed back today with the statement of his own saying that he did the right thing yesterday and will continue to follow both the law and the constitution. We should note, the president's anger at Sessions previously has been about not being tough enough about investigating Hillary Clinton. Well, today, NBC News reported that some witnesses are being asked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about whether the president as Candidate Trump, knew in advance about the hacks of those Democratic emails. So, a lot going on tonight, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, that's all that happened today. Very quiet day in the White House. You know, I mean, obviously, Ed, we hear a lot about the inner workings of who is sort of trying to consolidate power inside the White House. And every time one of these messages come out, you wonder if it's coming from the other side trying to make the other side look bad.  What more do we know about that tonight? HENRY: Well, remember the context. A couple weeks ago, it was chief of staff John Kelly who was in deep trouble over his mishandling -- but mishandling, really, of the Rob Porter story, and the shifting statements and all of that. It now looks like he's on the rise again. Remember, this happened in the context of Josh Raffel, who had been a spokesman for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump announced yesterday abruptly he's leaving. And he has got other opportunities in the private sector that happens in Democratic and Republican White Houses. Hope Hicks, we're told, had signaled in recent weeks she wanted to leave as well. But it's important to note that I'm hearing that General Kelly has want some of these people pushed aside. And he wants to pick up his own power, number one. And number two, he's been saying this for a long time in private that family members shouldn't be around here, and it's been more difficult for the White House. Hope Hicks, remember, has basically, even though she's not family is considered family. MACCALLUM: Yes, practically family. There are reports that the staff is demoralized. Obviously, a lot of them are very close to Hope Hicks. She has a great reputation. She's very well-liked among most people who've worked with her. HENRY: You know what, some of the senior advisors I talked to had say what they're frustrated about is, yes, she's somebody who has been popular around here. But also, beyond Hope Hicks, you had a president today who was talking for a long period of time about not just gun control, but he's reframing this issue as school safety. And what is he doing as a Republican, it's not getting noticed a lot by the mainstream media. But he's kind of taking on the NRA on background checks and other things, saying I'm not scared of the NRA. I had them in here at the White House for lunch a few days ago and we're going to work out a deal -- back to the art of the deal. Everyone said, he couldn't get a tax cut. He got a tax cut. Now, he's saying he's going to get something on background checks.  If he's able to do that, that's going to be a big development around here.  But my point is, it's being completely overshadowed by all of these other issues. MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Yes, the communications message of that meeting got stepped on by this news, coming out of the White House right after that. Ed, thank you very much. HENRY: Good to see you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, joining me now, David Bossie, worked with Hope Hicks as the Deputy Campaign Manager when he was with the 2016 Campaign for President Trump; he's a Fox News Contributor. David, good evening, good to see you. DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Thanks for having me. MACCALLUM: You were shocked by this news, you say. BOSSIE: You know what, I was. You know, I know that Hope has been looking for -- you know, looking to do other things for quite some time now. But it's always a surprise when it actually happens for folks that are close to her. MACCALLUM: So, what do you make of this John Kelly information that perhaps he is pushing back against some members of the team and wants to consolidate power? Do you think that's true? BOSSIE: You know, look. I think these -- Hope Hicks is one of the most important members of that senior staff. She is, as you were just saying a moment ago, she is like family to this president. And, you know, I don't really know anybody that is able to or should want to push her out. I think that those stories are just rubbish coming out of the White House, you know, or whatever those sources are. I think that that's not accurate.  I think that this -- that Hope Hicks is one of the most thoughtful people that I got to work with, and I enjoyed working with her on the campaign.  You know, I think she -- I hold her in the highest regard. She is somebody who is dedicated to this president and dedicated to her country. And those things, and I can just say she is -- has the ear of the president and I'm glad that she has had that ear for the last several years. MACCALLUM: You know, a couple of people that I spoke to who were inside the House Intel Committee testimony yesterday said that there was absolutely no indication that this was coming, that there was nothing that happened during that meeting that would've prompted this resignation. Do you -- is that what you've heard, and do you agree with that? BOSSIE: You know what, I only had heard that the interview was very normal matter of fact, and nothing of any interest. So, I would find it hard to believe that anything like this would've come up yesterday or anybody would've had any information about it. It's not something that would've been talked about during a committee questioning session. MACCALLUM: You know, the white lies comment, you know, that she tells white lies occasionally for the president. The way that I'm hearing that was that it was a question that was posed for her: do you ever lie for the president? And that she and her attorneys stepped out for a moment and clarified perhaps what was the discussion about, you know, well, sometimes, you know this is happening or that's happening, and I might say, you know, we can't make it because of this reason. Do I need to say that? The suggestion was, you know, how much do I need to include here? BOSSIE: Martha, that's incredibly appropriate. MACCALLUM: And that she came back in and assured them it had nothing to do with Russia, but there was occasionally time during her job where she might have to say something that wasn't 100 percent true. BOSSIE: Right. People shouldn't read in -- for her to stop and talk to her attorneys and make sure that she's not mis-answering a question, because she thinks it's about one thing and wants to make sure. Look, communications staff in this town, you know, have -- since the dawn of time, told white -- you know, little fibs to the media to get them off their back, and that is part and parcel of any comms director or for Member of Congress or anywhere else. And that's just to try to buy time whatever the issue is. Those are nothing burgers. To me, that's a red herring.  That's nothing. MACCALLUM: David, thanks. Good to see you tonight. BOSSIE: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, here now with more, Karl Rove, very familiar with the inner workings of the White House, Former Senior Advisor to President George W.  Bush and a Fox News Contributor. Karl, good to see you tonight. KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Good to see you, Martha. MACCALLUM: You know, you've been listening to all of this, to Ed, to David. What are your thoughts on this whole thing? ROVE: Well, mystified. Look, she is one of the closest people to the president. She obviously cares deeply about the president and is loyal to him. And she's in charge -- she played a big role in the communications in the White House. This was not good communications on behalf of the president or the White House. The president had a day full of other messages he wanted to get across, and she came out 24 hours after leaving what must've been exhaustive, I think, almost nine hours on Capitol Hill and announced that she's leaving. So, we're all going to be speculating about why, and not paying attention to what the president was trying to draw attention to today by his round tables. And so, I'm a little mystified. I don't buy that this has something to do with General Kelly. I think it has everything to do with a 29-year-old who is in a high-pressure environment. You know, if you have gone to Capitol Hill and testified behind closed doors as I did after I left the White House, being interrogated by Adam Schiff for hours upon hours, upon hours. It was not a pleasant experience and couldn't have been pleasant for her, either. MACCALLUM: I mean, that's an excellent point. And there's, you know, some indication that the pressures of all of it. Sometimes you look at these folks in these jobs, and you've been there, Karl, and you wonder how they last as long as they do all the way through that grueling campaign, and now into this period of almost no time for personal life or anything else. ROVE: Average tenure of a senior White House aide is about 18 months. So, it's not unusual to be losing people. This administration has lost a lot more people a lot more quickly. The pace is extraordinary. But you're right, even on a good day in a good administration where people are not knifing each other in the back, it's a tough place to work. When I was there, I had hair and it wasn't gray. So -- MACCALLUM: I do think that your point about the timing is interesting though, because, you know, when you're engineering communications, and you've just had this very wide ranging and fascinating discussion about school safety. To have this drop right after that, does definitely step on that message. It could've come out. And if it's been planned for a while, it could've come out, you know, Friday afternoon when they're sort of in the clear. ROVE: Right. MACCALLUM: So, it is interesting timing. What do you think about the Jeff Sessions tweet that the president sent out this morning? ROVE: I was taken aback. First of all, calling your attorney general disgraceful is an invitation for him to leave the office. And if the president wants him to go, the best way to do it is to call Sessions into his office and say, Jeff, I think you need to go. To play this out in front of the American people this way is really harmful to the president and makes it difficult to recruit somebody else. And look, let's assume for a minute that Jeff Sessions said, OK, I get the message and go. Do you know who the first victim of this will be? Not Jeff Sessions. It will be President Trump himself. Does the president really want to go through the difficult struggle now to find somebody of impeccable integrity to do that job and go through a three or four or five-month long confirmation battle where his nominee bleeds all over the floor as every Democrat, asks every ugly question and uses every moment they can to make this a big deal in the middle of the 2018 election.  So, first of all, I'm just taken aback by it. Second of all, the inspector general is the person that the president wants to have do this. He is insulated from the rest of the department, he has complete independence. And Michael Horowitz, both in the Bush Administration and in the Obama Administration, and this administration, has shown himself willing to take on the tough things. Remember, this is the guy who sends to Robert Mueller the e-mail traffic and text messages of Peter Strzok, and says this guy is doing bad things and Mueller fires him immediately. So, you want, if you're the president, any kind of investigation along these lines to be done by somebody who is independent. By saying is this guy an Obama guy? The president is saying I want you to have this investigated by a partisan and the Democrats would just simply dismiss that if that were to happen. MACCALLUM: Yes. Great point. Karl, thank you. Great to see tonight. ROVE: You bet. Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, we have this story for you as the Parkland survivors bravely return to the school today for the first time since the shooting two weeks ago. President Trump takes on the issues of gun control, standing up to the NRA, and a lot more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, D-CONN.: First, I think you underestimate the power of the gun lobby. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified. They want to do what's right. (END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Who better to talk to about this than NRA Spokesperson Dana Loesch? She joins me in a moment to respond, coming up next. Also, March madness, well, right around the corner, right? It's almost March.  Starting tomorrow. But one NBA super star says it is not all one shiny moment, folks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEBRON JAMES, BASKETBALL PLAYER, NBA: The NCAA is corrupt. We know that. I'm sorry. It's going to make headlines, but it's corrupt.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have to do something about it. We now have to do some -- we have to act. We can't wait and play games, and nothing gets done.(END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Action is what the president says he wants to sees as Parkland students today went back to school. They began their day with fourth period classes exactly where they were when the shooting began two weeks ago. I can only imagine what it was like for these children today. In a moment, NRA Spokesperson Dana Loesch joins us with her reaction to the president's strong message today. But first, the substantive conversation on change that had members of both parties once again at the table in the White House, in a free ranging conversation discussing what the next moves needs to be. Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with more on that for us tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hi, Martha, by beginning with fourth period not only would the student be exactly where they were, during the shooting, but more importantly, they'd be alongside the people they were with when the horror began. Overall, at Stoneman Douglas High, it was a day of hugs, tears, and gapping voids. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was kind of hard for me because I lost someone like a sister to me. So, it was difficult because we went to school together and left together, like, every day. So, without her being there, it was really difficult. (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The teens came back to campus guarded by police and welcomed by everyone from teachers, to parents, to animals -- dogs, donkeys, even a horse that carried eagle pride. When the final bell rang, some students walked in groups. Others walked hand in hand. They say it's important for them to move forward as long as the country doesn't just move on. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: While Douglas has the media's attention, while we have the nation's attention. We're going to make the most of it, and we're not going to stop until we get what we want. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- until we get our change. (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Yes, and while change is often slow, this time it appears steady. Florida GOP lawmakers have now approved a bill that calls for putting 10 teachers trained to carry a gun in each and every Florida school. The measure, clearly will have significant opposition. And on the national level during a blunt and often surprising back and forth between the president and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace comprehensive gun legislation that would expand background checks, raise the age limit to buy guns, and keep weapons away from the mentally ill. Here is the president talking about the NRA. Watch this back and forth. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn't make sense that I have to wait until I'm 21 to get a handgun but can I get this weapon at 18. I don't know. So, I'm just curious as to what you did in your bill. SEN. PAT TOOMEY, R—PENNSYLVANIA: We didn't address it, Mr. President. Look, I think we.TRUMP: You know why, because you're afraid of the NRA. (END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Yes. Later, Senator Toomey told Fox News he did not believe the president was directing that NRA comment at him. Martha. MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. So, also today, President Trump going all in defending at times the NRA and taking a swipe at some lawmakers who he said are ""petrified of them"". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm a big fan of the NRA. I had lunch with them with Wayne, and Chris, and David on Sunday and said it's time. We've got to stop this nonsense. It's time. You can't buy a handgun at 18, 19, or 20. You have to wait until you are 21. But you can buy the gun, the weapon used in this horrible shooting at 18. And I'm a fan of the NRA. I mean, no bigger fan.  I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. MURPHY: I think you under estimate the power of the gun lobby. TRUMP: No, no. I'll tell you what, the reason I had lunch with the NRA on Sunday. I called them, I said, you got to come over. I said, fellas, we got to do something, and they do have great power. I agree with that.  They have great power over you, people. They have less power over me.  Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified. They want to do what's right. (END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Here now, Dana Loesch, NRA Spokesperson. Dana, good to see you tonight. I know that this whole conversation was taking place when you were on the air this afternoon on your radio show and that you listened to it very closely, no doubt. What did you -- I'm curious what you thought about the whole tone of what this discussion seemed to be centered on. DANA LOESCH, SPOKESPERSON, NRA: Right. And Martha, again, thank you so much for talking about this issue. I thought it made for really good T.V., but I thought some of what was discussed is going to make for really bad policy that is not going to protect our kids. Now, you heard the president, Martha, say that NRA leadership, met with him on Sunday and on behalf of members, there are two things that were stressed to the president. The first one is that we absolutely have to harden our schools and we have to protect our kids. There are millions of NRA members, and we're parents, too. I have kids in school. And so, this is an issue that I desperately want to see resolved. Which is why we're pushing for action on this as well. The second thing that was stressed to the president is that we also must respect and protect the rights of law abiding Americans all across the country, who right now, are being punished for the failures of government.  Martha, it wasn't millions of gun owners who were missing the 45 calls to the Broward sheriff's office. And it wasn't us who were missing the two FBI tips. And it's not innocent law-abiding Americans all across the country who have, for decades, ignored the mental health crisis in this country. That was the political class. And the same political class right now is coming and telling all of these innocent Americans that we're the ones that have to pay for their failures. And we stressed that to the president; we said, look, I mean, this is -- you can't restrict the rights of law abiding Americans. And I want to be really clear what we're talking about here, we're talking about punishing innocent Americans and stripping from them constitutional rights without due process and making them pay for what the political class. MACCALLUM: I couldn't agree with you that there needs to be a lot of focus on the errors at the FBI and at law enforcement. It is unbelievable what slipped through these people's fingers, and they need to be held accountable. This is, to me, is the scariest part of what happened there. LOESCH: It is. MACCALLUM: But in terms of the issue -- you know, for instance, the 21 issue, why is it -- why is it that the NRA seems fine with not being able to get a handgun until 21, but you're not in favor of not being able to get a long gun until 21. And it's interesting, just tonight, Walmart came out and made a statement, they said that they will no longer sell guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21. LOESCH: Right. That's the scary thing, because it's not -- this isn't actually going to solve -- the people who are going to be affected by this law, Martha, is not the 19-year-old gang banger in Chicago, and it is not the people who are mentally been found mentally unfit and dangerous to themselves and others. The people who are going to be affected by this are people like I was. When I was 20-years-old and I lived on my own. It would deprive me of any right -- any method of defending myself. The people that it's going to affect are the 19-year-old law-abiding American who just wants to go and deer hunt, or the person who maybe wants to do a three-gun competition with hopes of competing someday. Those are the people it's going to affect. Future servicemen and women or current servicemen and women when they go and they enlist it's going to affect their ability to protect themselves at home as well. Making people wait doesn't solve psychosis. And once again, we're punishing law abiding Americans, stripping from them a right without due process. MACCALLUM: Do you believe -- there has to be enough in place to be able to stop this young shooter in Florida from getting a gun that is not connected to his age, because clearly, he was on the radar of law enforcement, and clearly, he had mental health problems. He was the first who did it. LOESCH: He was. And there was an article that came out in the Miami Herald as well, Martha, that discussed -- it was talking to Florida prosecutors. And I brought this up at the town hall. There's a Florida law that would have actually allowed law enforcement to arrest this individual and charge him with a felony, because he was sending written electronic death threats to classmates -- that's a violation of Florida law. And under that law, they could've actually arrested him. They could've looked this further.MACCALLUM: Dana, I want to squeeze in one more question for you because the president talked about --I'm sorry. The president talked about due process today. And he said, you have to take away the firearms first and then go to court when you have a question about whether or not the person who has that gun should really have it in terms of their mental stability. Quick thought on that before we go. LOESCH: Well, the NRA is going to -- first off, action and push for action on protecting children. But the NRA is also going to protect due process for innocent Americans. And that is an approach that we are going to hold to. Due process must be respected and we stressed this to the president at the lunch on Sunday, it is a foundational principle of this country. Due process must be protected and it must be respected in terms of going around any solutions -- MACCALLUM: So, let me ask you, because there definitely some differences -- LOESCH: We have school shields, any Eagles program, so many, Martha. And I want people, by the way, can I really tell people to check out nraschoolshield.com. Our resources are at their disposal. MACCALLUM: All right. You got a lot of differences with the president. Some similarities, some things you have a lot in common. Do you think that you're going to be able to work this out? LOESCH: We are in lock step -- Martha, we are in lock step with the president on protecting children. We are in total agreement with him on that. MACCALLUM: I think everybody is in lock step with that. LOESCH: And, but we want to respect due process. MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, Dana. Good to see you tonight. Thanks for being here. LOESCH: Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, still to come tonight. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announcing a new task force go after opioid makers in an effort to combat this national crisis. We're going to speak to a mother who knows the heartbreaking cost of all of this too well. She has a message for all of us and all of you at home, you can't miss. Plus, a stunning new report from the U.N. that ties North Korea to Syria's chemical weapons program. So, what are the ramifications for North Korea with this? Benjamin Hall has been on the front lines of this war. He joins us next with the human cost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAED SALEH, LEADER, WHITE HELMETS (through translator): Volunteers have to make crucial decisions about taking people from rubble. No medical point. No hospitals there. No safe place to transfer those injured.(END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST: Developing tonight, in the same week that President Trump leaves the door open to talks with North Korea, the U.N. releases a stunning report connecting the rogue regime to Syria's chemical weapons program. It comes amid one of the deadliest weeks in the country in rebel held Eastern Ghouta. Alone, more than 500 people have died. Look at these pictures of this completely destroyed city. I think about 400,000 people live there. Here's how the leader of the white helmets. They're volunteers who go in and rescue people under these unbelievable circumstances. Describes what they are dealing with now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  RAED SALEH, WHITE HELMETS LEADER: Two words, dooms day. Volunteers have to make crucial decisions about taking people from rubble. No medical point. No hospitals there. No safe place to transfer those injured. What we have witnessed in the last few weeks, international communities facing one of helpless in crisis. United Nations can't do anything in Syria.(END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: Fox News' Benjamin Hall has been on the front lines of this civil war and he has seen these atrocities firsthand. He joins us live in London tonight with the story. Ben, good to see you tonight. Obviously, things have ramped up in Eastern Ghouta. And this is a horrific situation. And now we're learning that some of these weapons are coming from North Korea? BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. As you said, this is a stunning report from the U.N., and it began as an investigation into North Korea and how they were getting around the sanctions the international community was setting on them. Well, the experts found that they were taken down on this trail which led all the way to the battle field of Syria. And what they discovered there was that North Korea had been actively helping Syria in the production of chemical weapons. It said the Chinese companies have been behind North Korean shipments of at least 20 or 50 tons of material for use in Syrian chemical making facilities. It also says that North Korean technicians of at least three Syrian military facilities right now. Syria's regime has been regularly accused of using chemical weapons. Most recently just two days ago in the besieged rebel held area of Ghouta. Ghouta has been, as you say, under heavy bombardment for much for the last 10 days, as the Assad regime now pushes for total victory. At least 500 people have died in the last week alone. Its 400,000 residents cannot escape. They have little access to food and water. They're all hiding and livings in basements. Its hospitals are now being regularly targeted and being hit from everything from incendiary bombs to chemicals, and numerous groups have been suggesting this is genocide. Well, this new report is the first real evidence of active collusion between North Korea and Syria despite the two nations being under the strictest international sanctions. And there's no doubt that any profit will go towards funding North Korea's own military programs. But the relationship between North Korea and Syria goes back decades. In 1967, North Korean pilots fought alongside Syrian pilots against Israel in the six day war, and they build their first nuclear reactor. But what is new is learning how they manage to get around international sanctions and work on these horrible, horrible chemicals which kill indiscriminately. Martha. MACCALLUM: They have said that they're not using chemical weapons. They remember what happened the last time. It was documented that they did. The Trump administration sent in missiles shortly after that. These are chlorine bombs and chlorine weapons. Describe to us the nature of what they do and the damage that they do, Ben. HALL: Martha, as I said, they are indiscriminate. And I've spoken to many survivors of these attacks who have lost entire families. They're indiscriminate because they attack children first. They have the most susceptible lungs. And they get into the lungs, they start dissolving them. The nerve agents they have been known to use in the past, the sarin gas, well, that hits the nervous system and it's excruciating painful. Many mothers and fathers having to watch their children die because they're the ones that really go first. But, of course, Syria was supposed to give up its chemical weapons program under a deal that Russia negotiated in 2013.  And that was after Obama had set the red line. Well, they haven't given it up. There've been documented of using since then. Trump did act, and now France and the U.K. are also saying if they use chemicals again they may well act. So we're seeing change. But still, evidence from this report and the reporting I've done on the ground that the Syrian government continues to use these weapons. MACCALLUM: One last question for you. You mentioned in your report that it is Chinese companies, a Chinese mining company, I believe, that is doing the transport of this piping and these tiles that allow the construction of these chemical weapons, isn't China supposed to be implementing sanctions against North Korea? HALL: They are. And they've made some moves for years. They've been making the right sounds. But people have always suspected that North Korea acts as a thorn in the side of the U.S. for them. And these Chinese companies have been acting as shell companies. They've had numerous businessmen abroad saying that they represented North Korean financial institute. So, yes, China is supposed to be on board. Yes, we've seen them crack down to some degree, but North Korea seemingly able to get around them. And, of course, using that money for their own nuclear and ballistic missile programs. MACCALLUM: Ben Hall, great reporting as always. Thank you very much, Ben. Good to see you tonight. HALL: You too. MACCALLUM: So still ahead, one of the biggest names in basketball is crying foul on the NCAA, why LeBron James says college basketball is corrupt. And as the DEA issues a dire new warning to Congress today about the growing opioid epidemic. This mother, Beth Schmidt, who lost her son to the crisis, has a message about where we are with this and where we need to go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUSAN GIBSON, DEA: The opioid crisis has been and will unfortunately continue to be the top threat facing our nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Our nation is facing the deadliest drug epidemic in our history. And make no mistake, what we're talking about today is not business as usual. The department of justice has taken historic new actions to reverse the rising tide of addiction and death.(END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: Awful situation. And the federal response to our nation's opioid crisis is ramping up this week. The Justice Department announcing a new task force to go after the drug manufacturers. And this week, lawmakers holding hearings on Capitol Hill to find ways to combat this epidemic, as the White House prepares to host a summit on this tomorrow. It is now estimated that 5 people die per hour of an overdose, something that my next guest knows all too well. Beth Schmidt lost her son, Sean, in 2013 to an opioid overdose, and she joins me now. Beth, thank you very much for being here tonight. BETH SCHMIDT, LOST SON TO OPIOD OVERDOSE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Tell us a little but about what happened to Sean, so that other families can understand how quickly and how easily this can happen. SCHMIDT: Well, Sean came to me probably in 2011. He came to me in 2011 and told me that he was addicted to heroin. We probably saw signs as early as 2010. However, hindsight is 20/20. MACCALLUM: Sure. SCHMIDT: He got into treatment and he spent a little bit of time in jail after he relapsed, and by Christmas, 2013, he was no longer with us. It's devastating and he -- his struggle was very quick and very fast. But it was very hard. MACCALLUM: Talk to me about -- obviously, at least now there is so much focus on this problem. It's an epidemic. And more people die of this than anything else in the United States right now. How do you feel about the pace of what's happening? Is it quick enough for you? Is it effective enough for you? SCHMIDT: It's absolutely not fast enough, but we are moving forward and we're moving forward steadily. In Sean's case, it was just -- there was so much stigma. Stigma kills. And he was afraid to come forward. He was afraid to ask for help. He was ashamed of himself. He was afraid of the embarrassment that he would cause his family. And he didn't cause us any embarrassment. And we helped him with open arms and open hearts. And that's what we need to do. We need to help people that are struggling. We hear all too often all they need to do is ask for help. But if you ask for help and there's no place to go, then what are you supposed to do. So stigma -- competing against stigma is very difficult for someone that's struggling. MACCALLUM: Understood. SCHMIDT: And if we can reduce that and we can increase funding -- reduce stigma and increase funding, then a lot more people can stand a chance because this is horrible. MACCALLUM: Beth, do you believe that the funding has to go. I've spoken with another dad recently who built his own house -- started a foundation because he said there wasn't anywhere that was decent enough for his daughter to go to rehab. Is that where you'd like to see the focus going in terms of money? SCHMIDT: Absolutely. Recovery -- there's not enough -- there's not enough focus on recovery. We have a lot of focus on detox. But once they go through detox. Once they go through rehab. My son was accepted into a 28- day program where the insurance company sent him home after 11 days, and they sent him home to me. MACCALLUM: Not enough.SCHMIDT: What was I supposed to do? How was I supposed to help that? We don't have enough recovery homes. We don't have enough support once someone goes through that rehab process. We need supports at home. MACCALLUM: Beth, thank you very much. We will stay on it and we're going to cover the summit tomorrow, and we need to see progress on this. I thank you for your courage. And we're all sorry for your loss of your son, Sean. I know you don't want it to be in vain. Thank you so much. SCHMIDT: No, I do not. Thank you so much. MACCALLUM: So, coming up next.

It's corrupt.(END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: LeBron James taking a shot at the NCAA over corruption. Is he right? That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So one of the biggest names in the NBA making some pretty bold strong claims about the NCAA. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JAMES: I'm not a fan of the NCAA. I love watching March Madness. I think that's incredible. I'm not a fan how the kids don't benefit from none of this. I know, as the NBA, we have to figure out a way that we can share up our farm league and this kids, you know, feel like they don't want to be a part of that NCAA program. We have something here for them to be able to jump back on and not have to worry about going overseas all the time. I guess. NCAA is cool. It's cool. It's going to make headlines. It's corrupt.(END VIDEO CLIP)  MACCALLUM: That, as we get ready for the Big East and March Madness, here now, Jim Gray, Fox News sports analyst. Jim, obviously, he's talking about all of the corruption that we have seen. There's been FBI investigation ongoing of many of these top tier NCAA teams for essentially bribery and corruption and setting people up and saying, well, you're going to go with this agent and you're going to go with Adidas after you're done. Where are we going with this? JIM GRAY, FOX NEWS SPORTS ANALYST: Well, we're going down the same path we've known and we've been going down for a long time, it's just that the FBI is now involved, Martha. So now, this gives legitimacy to all of those people who've known all this for all of this time to say the underbelly and what goes on underneath college basketball is corrupt. LeBron is exactly right. And President Obama spoke out and he said that the NCAA cannot sustain itself going like this and it can't just be a farm league for the NBA. But asking the NCAA at this point to come up with reform after they've been complicit and corrupt in this is really kind of like asking the turkeys to organize Thanksgiving. MACCALLUM: Yeah. Let's look at this quote from the head of the NCAA. Where is it? There we go. From Mark Emmert, the board and I are completely committed to making transformational changes to the game and ensuring all involved in college basketball do so with integrity. He goes on to say, we will also continue to cooperate with the efforts of federal prosecutors to identify and punish the unscrupulous parties seeking to exploit the system through criminal acts. He is shocked, shocked, shocked. GRAY: And that's golly. And I have tremendous respect for him and I personally like him, but where have you been? If that's your take on this, I mean, what closet have you been in? What sand is your ostrich head in?  I mean, that's absurd -- that's obscene to now perpetuate that to the public and act as though you have no knowledge. Why do you have a compliance department? Why do we have these scandals going on all the time? If this is what the head of this is saying, something is beyond drastically wrong. MACCALLUM: So you think we need to start paying these players so that it takes away the incentive for these kinds of bribery? GRAY: Absolutely. Everybody is profiting here, Martha, the shoe companies, the agents, the institutions, the coaches, they're all making millions and millions and billions of dollars, and the only people that can't touch it are the players. They're the ones that are creating all of this. It's crazy. It's insane. They have had a long time to figure it out, and they've got to figure it out. They've got to pay these guys because it's just outright wrong. And it's been wrong for a long time and that's why there's all these stuff underneath the table. MACCALLUM: Should they pay them in a way that they don't get until they graduate in a way that would encourage them in their education? GRAY: Look, there's been a big fallacy for a long time. These are not student athletes. These are athletes-students. They're there for one purpose. MACCALLUM: Some of them are. GRAY: Most of them, particularly the one and done. And these big programs go so that they can get the exposure, so that they can move onto the NBA right away, so that they can get a big salary. And if that's the case, then we should quit putting these people in school and saying that they're there for an education because they're really there for a basketball career or a football career. And if they don't fundamentally change that, and make that so that it's exactly what it is and transparent, then they're going to always have these problems because all of these people are going to be delivered and then you get exploitation. MACCALLUM: We'll wait for the full commission report. Condoleezza Rice involved in this. And we'll see where it goes. Jim, thank you. GRAY: Martha, good to be with you. Good to be here. MACCALLUM: Thanks for coming. So coming up next, we remember the late- Reverend Billy Graham. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Finally tonight, a live look at the capitol where the Reverend Billy Graham's remains lie in honor tonight in the rotunda.

33,"During a bipartisan meeting between Trump and lawmakers, the president issued new gun safety proposals to increase school safety. Here are the president's proposals.In the weeks after a gunman walked into a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members, survivors aren't giving up their fight for stronger gun control efforts.Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teenagers have moved front and center in the gun control debate, organizing a coming national school walkout, meeting with President Donald Trump, lobbying state lawmakers and participating in protests.Since the Feb. 14 shooting, several ideas have been floated by the White House, Republicans, Democrats and state officials to combat gun violence. Trump also hosted a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House to discuss reform.Here are six measures lawmakers are now debating.Trump and Republicans suggested the possibility of arming teachers after the school shooting – and Florida lawmakers moved closer to do that this week.A school safety bill that, among other things, would allow up to 10 school personnel to be armed, narrowly passed the Florida state House in March, and Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed it into law.On Twitter, Trump promoted the idea of having “highly trained, gun adept” teachers and coaches in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrived or serve as a “deterrent to the cowards that do this.”I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” Trump tweeted.....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio, already train a group of select teachers and faculty members to confront an active shooter. These staff members, whose identities are not revealed, have access to safes throughout the schools which have guns hidden inside.Ohio offers funding for schools to train staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff members who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.Trump has seemed open to strengthening the federal background check process for gun purchases, saying it should be a bipartisan effort to do so.Gun control advocates point to what they see as “loopholes” in the current system that could allow for people to purchase guns even when they legally should not be able to do so.Interactive Map: State-level gun reform legislationA bevy of bills could broadly redefine gun laws across America. Click on your state below to see the latest proposed gun legislation. (Mobile users: Click here to view the map.)Specifically, Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, noted the ability for consumers to purchase guns from a private seller without completing a background check.“It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller,” Oransky told Fox News.He also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.“It’s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious, but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller.”However, Second Amendment advocates argue the background check system already does too much.“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.Graphic shows how the bump stock accelerates the firing rate of a semiautomatic rifle; 2c x 3 inches; 96.3 mm x 76 mm.

In the wake of the Parkland shooting, Trump said he signed an order instructing the Justice Department to ban bump stocks, an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to resemble a fully automatic weapon.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said top officials in the Justice Department believe they can ban bump stocks through the regulatory process. However, gun manufacturers and owners are likely to sue if they are banned without any legislation from Congress.Bump stocks were approved in 2010 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after concluding the devices did not turn guns into machine guns, which are prohibited under the National Firearms Act.The devices weren’t used in the Parkland shooting, but the massacre did reignite the debate over whether they should be banned.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said he's open to changing his stance on one gun control measure after meeting with survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting: high-capacity magazines.""I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it, I am reconsidering that position,"" Rubio said during a recent town hall. ""While it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack ... So we'll have to get into that debate, but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise [on] in this country, and that I'm willing to reconsider.""The suspected gunman had to stop to reload his firearm during the massacre, which Rubio added was “evidence in this case that it saved the lives of some people.” Several measures introduced in states across the country – including in Colorado, Illinois and Rhode Island – would ban high-capacity magazines.After hosting survivors of gun violence and their parents at the White House, Trump publicly backed raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21.“There’s nothing more important than protecting our children,” Trump said. When Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., acknowledged that a bill he’s sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to broaden background checks does not include raising the age limit, Trump accused him of being “afraid of the NRA.”National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch has already said the powerful gun lobby does not support raising the age limit to purchase certain firearms. After Trump’s White House meeting, she told Fox News it was “good TV,” but some of the proposals were “really bad policy.” “Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15.”However, some Republican senators, including Rubio and Pat Roberts of Kansas, have voiced support for raising the minimum age to purchase certain types of firearms.“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,"" Roberts said.The legislation Scott signed into law in March raised the minimum purchasing age for buying a rifle from 18 to 21.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, also announced it would stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone under the age of 21.AR-15 rifles are displayed for sale at the Guntoberfest gun show in Oaks, Pa.

House Democrats introduced a ban on semi-automatic firearms in February called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. More than 150 Democrats signed the legislation, the Washington Examiner reported.  According to a Harvard CAPS-Harris survey, 61 percent of respondents support banning the AR-15 firearm, used in many of the recent mass shootings in the U.S., including Parkland. Just 39 percent of respondents said adults who pass a background check should be allowed to purchase the firearm.Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in February that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm.But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America - our kids. https://t.co/J4OcB6XJnu pic.twitter.com/6VoKwJe8tH“We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods, said in a statement. “But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America – our kids.”Stack also said the company would stop selling high-capacity magazines and will continue its policy of not selling bump stocks.“Some will say these steps can’t guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again. They may be correct – but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it,” Stack said.Multiple companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting.

Trump encouraged lawmakers not to be afraid to disagree with the NRA, the powerful nonprofit that advocates for gun rights, during a televised meeting with lawmakers.“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump said. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”Several companies have cut ties with the NRA since the Parkland school shooting. Among them are: Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, MetLife, United and Delta.Georgia lawmakers voted to yank a tax break for Atlanta-based Delta on March 1 after the airline severed ties with the NRA.The bill cleared the state House with an overwhelming 135-24 vote, after being approved in the state Senate on a 44-10 vote. It was then sent to the governor's desk.The final version dropped an earlier amendment that would have renewed a jet fuel tax exemption worth $50 million that was taken off the books in 2015.I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA.  Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.“Businesses have every legal right to make their own decisions, but the Republican majority in our state legislature also has every right to govern guided by our principles,” said Lieutenant Gov. Casey Cagle, who threatened to kill the airline tax break days prior to the vote.The threat prompted liberal governors nationwide to court the airline, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who tweeted his support and encouraged Delta to move its headquarters north.“Now more than ever the NRA is showing just how out of step they are with the American people,” Cuomo said in a statement, calling the NRA's agenda “dangerous.”The NRA has fired back at companies like Delta – and at the lawmakers encouraging them – for allegedly not supporting the Second Amendment.“Ultimately, our members are passionate #2A supporters. Having those on the left pushing for a boycott to pressure companies to drop discounts just shows how out of touch some are,” the NRA said on Twitter.Fox News’ Jennifer Earl, Matt Finn, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Kaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

35,"One of the nation's leading gun-control advocacy groups announced plans on Friday to spend upwards of $1 million in the upcoming Virginia gubernatorial and attorney general races even though a similar spending effort failed to flip control of the state senate in 2015.The Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a New York-based gun-control group founded in large part by Michael Bloomberg, is donating $450,000 to Democrat Ralph Northam in his race against Republican Ed Gillespie. They're spending another $250,000 on mailers supporting Northam. The gun-control group is putting another $300,000 into Democrat Attorney General Mark Herring's reelection bid.Northam and Herring contrast with their Republican opponents on gun policy. Northam supports an assault weapons ban, magazine size limits, universal background checks, and a return to the one-gun-a-month rule—all distinctions from Gillespie. Herring also supports universal background checks and the one-gun-a-month rule, and his campaign website touts his record as one of standing up to the ""gun lobby and a legislature that is beholden to it."" Herring's opponent, Republican John Adams, has promised to ""vigorously defend the Second Amendment.""We are making this initial investment because Ralph Northam and Mark Herring have been forceful champions for gun violence prevention in Virginia, while their opponents subscribe to a dangerous ‘guns everywhere’ agenda,"" Brynne Craig, a senior strategist for Everytown, told the Washington Post.Northam, Herring, and current Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe were all involved in attempts by the executive branch to circumvent Virginia's legislative branch and implement new gun-control measures in the wake of the state's 2015 election. In October 2015, Gov. McAuliffe, with Lt. Gov. Northam's support, issued an executive order banning guns from all state buildings. In December 2015, Attorney General Herring announced his plan to unilaterally eliminate most of the state's gun-carry reciprocity deals with other states.Click for more from Washington Free Beacon. ",0

                                In the wake of the mass shooting at a church in Texas, Miley Cyrus appears to be fed up and has taken to social media to denounce gun violence, President Trump and the shooter.On Monday, “The Voice” coach posted an image of text to her Instagram listing the victims of the attack. In her emotional caption, she laments how disgusting such an act is and highlights the shooter as a terrorist and “WHITE AMERICAN MAN!” She later notes that she’s both “disgusted” and “embarrassed” by her country for not taking action on gun violence.The post received a lot of attention, prompting the star to write another. In the second one, she calls out Trump and his reaction to the tragedy.“I'd like to believe that EVERY person who takes the life of another being is ‘mentally ill,’” she said, quoting the president’s words. “It's hard to conceptualize that a sane human could commit such a hideous crime. BUT I am sorry Donald Trump this absolutely is a ‘GUNS SITUATION.’”The “Wrecking Ball” singer went on after the critics of her previous post who noted that the shooter’s skin color or sex shouldn’t matter. Cyrus noted that she believes things like skin color, gender and religion seem to matter when it comes to labeling terrorist activity.“DONT START to be all innocent! Gender, race, & religion HAS and continues to matter for all the wrong reasons & that's only the beginning of how backwards this country is!”The star ended her Instagram tirade with an attempt to show she’s not villainizing white Americans by posting three images of her with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, and two brothers, Braison and Trace, noting that they were a few of her “favorite WHITE AMERICAN MALES…” Just a few of my favorite WHITE AMERICAN MALES .... I do NOT & refuse to generalize or stereotype! Facts are Facts. You are all correct to believe every human deserves the same respect .... but please keep that in mind when you're judging others. NOT just with the race , religion , gender , or sexuality which YOU identify with. Deal? ❤️ (see last post before making your own uninformed assumptions )A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Nov 6, 2017 at 6:52am PST",0
39,"Since he’s taken office, President Trump has dealt with three of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history – and after the most recent high school massacre, he signaled that he’s willing to take action on certain gun control measures.After the Parkland, Florida shooting on Feb. 14, 2018 – which claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty members– Trump both defended the Second Amendment and called for a strengthening of federal background checks and a ban on devices that allow guns to rapidly fire.Here’s what the president has said about gun rights and control.In an all-caps tweet, Trump declared, “The Second Amendment will never be repealed!” He added that “as much as Democrats would like to see this happen,” the Second Amendment will remain in place.THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!Trump’s declaration came after former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens called for the repeal of the Second Amendment. Hundreds of thousands of students also walked out of school and participated in nationwide marches in protest of gun control in March.Aside from his tweet, Trump has also done things in office that point to his support of gun ownership. He nominated Neil Gorsuch – a federal judge who was praised by the National Rifle Association (NRA) as someone who “respects the Second Amendment” – to the Supreme Court in January 2017. He also signed a resolution blocking an Obama-era background check rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain people who suffer from mental illnesses.During the presidential campaign, Trump accused his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, of planning to eliminate the Second Amendment, using that fear as a rallying cry among conservative supporters.  In a 2012 interview with a Washington Times columnist, Trump said he has a concealed weapons permit for New York City and revealed he owns a HK45 and a .38 Smith & Wesson.Trump hosted a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House to talk about gun control and safety in February – and encouraged Republicans, especially, to stand up to the NRA.“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump said. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”During the meeting, Trump accused Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., of being “afraid of the NRA.” The NRA was a strong backer of Trump during the 2016 presidential election.Trump has also clashed with the powerful gun lobby on certain measures, including raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21. After Trump’s meeting with lawmakers, where he promoted that idea, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch told Fox News the meeting made for “good TV,” but some of the proposals were “really bad policy.”Even still, Trump has remained a stalwart defender of the NRA, including on social media. He said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre and chief lobbyist Chris Cox are “great people and great American patriots.”What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing.                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Since Trump’s public comments, top NRA members met with Trump at the White House. Cox signaled after the meeting that Trump does not “want gun control.”I had a great meeting tonight with @realDonaldTrump & @VP. We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control. #NRA #MAGABefore he became president, Trump criticized Republicans who he said “walk the NRA line” in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve.” In that book, Trump also said he supports a “ban on assault weapons,” according to Newsweek.Along with many Republicans, Trump floated the idea of arming some educators after the Parkland school shooting. He suggested having “highly trained, gun adept” teachers, coaches and faculty in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrive. These armed faculty members could also serve as a “deterrent to the cowards that do this,"" he said.“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” Trump said on social media.....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!Trump has called for strengthening the federal background check system for gun purchases, saying it should be a bipartisan effort to do so.The president has often promised to back “very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks,” including on social media.Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.......He also signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill in March 2018 that included a provision to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and provide additional funding to states and agencies that comply with the system. Those that do not, will be punished.Additionally, Trump has said he supports a ban on bump stocks, an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to resemble a fully automatic rifle. The devices were used in the 2017 Las Vegas concert massacre that left 58 people dead.The Justice Department has started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to clarify that the law defines bump stocks as machine guns, which are largely already illegal in the U.S., it said.I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!Trump, on social media, has blamed the Obama administration for the legalization of bump stocks. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) approved bump stocks in 2010.Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.Trump stunned Republicans and gun rights advocates, including the NRA, when he suggested law enforcement officials should be able to confiscate people’s firearms without a court order if doing so would prevent tragedies.“Take the guns first. Go through due process second,” Trump said during a meeting with lawmakers at the White House. “I like taking the guns early.” “I like taking the guns early.” Loesch later told Fox News that the NRA would “protect due process for innocent Americans.”“We stressed this to the president,” she said. “It is a foundational principle of this country and due process must be protected and respected in terms of going around any solutions.”President Trump hosted teachers and students who have been victims of school shootings, along with their parents, at the White House for a listening session in February 2018.

One of Trump’s most consistent proposals when it comes to firearm reform is eliminating gun-free zones.“Gun free zones are proven targets of killers,” he said on March 1.Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!“If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter,” Trump said on March 12. “Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!”If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!During a listening session with school shooting victims and their families, Trump said gun-free zones say “let’s go in and let’s attack because bullets aren’t coming back at us” to the “cowards” who commit these acts.Trump lamented gun-free zones during a 2012 interview with the Washington Times, as well. Citing the 2012 Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting, which left 12 people dead, Trump argued, “If some of the people in the movie theater had a gun, they’d have been shooting at him. Nobody had a gun so they were totally defenseless.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.Kaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News. Follow her on Twitter @K_Schallhorn.",0
43,"Lawmakers return to Washington to new calls for action; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill.Hundreds of college students from around the D.C. area are planning to stage a sit-in outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office next week, escalating their campaign for stricter gun laws in the wake of the Parkland shooting. The protest is being organized on Facebook, with organizers calling on volunteers to come to Capitol Hill with the understanding they will get arrested. “We will fight for: Universal Background Checks, an Assault Weapons Ban, and prohibiting domestic abusers from acquiring firearms. We will stay there until our Congress decides to listen and pass common sense gun reform,” a posting on the Facebook page says. The organizer is a University of Maryland student. The move comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle already are taking up the issue of school safety, with familiar divides emerging as Republicans stress security measures and Democrats aim for gun control. But some common ground could be emerging, as President Trump appeals to Democrats with calls to raise the purchase age for certain firearms and strengthen background checks. At the same time, he and other Republicans are calling for arming some teachers, a measure the National Rifle Association supports but Democrats largely oppose. The D.C. sit-in would mark the latest demonstration of civil disobedience being pursued by high school and college students after the mass shooting at a Florida high school. D.C.-area students protested outside the White House last week. That same day, Trump met with students, parents and teachers in one of his televised listening sessions on school safety.Students in Florida, including survivors from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, also rallied in the state capital last week for gun control measures. ",0
44,"Will other retailers follow suit? Television host Amy Robbins debates Rev. Rob Schenck on 'Fox & Friends First.'Several major gun manufacturers said they were severing ties with Dick’s Sporting Goods in response to the company's February announcement it would no longer sell assault-style weapons due to the deadly Parkland school shooting.O.F. Mossberg & Sons Inc., the parent company of Mossberg guns, announced Wednesday they would no longer be doing business with the sports retailer. Mossberg & Sons ended its association with Dick's after Dick’s hired three Washington, D.C., lobbyists to push for gun control efforts, the National Review reported.Dick's Sporting Goods announced in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting that it would stop selling assault-style weapons.
								
					        “It has come to our attention that Dick’s Sporting Goods recently hired lobbyists on Capitol Hill to promote additional gun control,” Mossberg & Sons CEO Iver Mossberg wrote in a press release. “Make no mistake, Mossberg is a staunch supporter of the U.S. Constitution and our Second Amendment rights, and we fully disagree with Dick’s Sporting Goods’ recent anti-Second Amendment actions.”DICK’S SPORTING GOODS TO DESTROY ALL UNSOLD FIREARMS PULLED FROM SHELVES AFTER PARKLAND SHOOTINGThe manufacturer called on customers to “visit one of the thousands of pro-Second Amendment firearm retailers” instead.The Mossberg announcement came just one day after MKS Supply, which makes Hi-Point firearms, also announced it would pull out of Dick's. Last week, gun manufacturer Springfield Armory said it was halting business with the sport’s supply company, too.“We believe that refusing to sell long guns to adults under age 21, while many young adults in our military are not similarly restricted, is wrong. We believe that villainizing modern sporting rifles in response to pressure from uninformed, anti-gun voices is wrong,” MKS Supply president Charles Brown wrote a statement. “We believe that hiring lobbyists to oppose American citizens’ freedoms secured by the Second Amendment is wrong. Dick’s Sporting Goods and Field & Stream, in purportedly doing all of these things, have demonstrated that they do not share our values. [We’re] standing by the American people by refusing any further sales to Dick’s Sporting Goods & Field & Stream.”NEW MEXICO WOMAN KIDNAPPED, MOLESTED OKLAHOMA BOY, AUTHORITIES SAYOn Feb. 28, Dick’s announced it would immediately stop selling assault-style rifles and ban the sales of all guns to anyone under 21. The Pittsburgh-based company announced last month it would destroy all unsold firearms pulled off the shelves. The sports retailer decided to make the changes after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, shot and killed 17 students and faculty with an AR-15. Cruz legally purchased the firearm.Following the massacre, shooting survivors called on Congress to pass stricter gun laws. The company previously pulled sporting rifles from its shelves after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.The sporting goods store is currently facing two lawsuits due to the imposed age limit on purchasing firearms.",0

Not signed up yet? Click here.Developing now, Friday, March 23, 2018THE LEAD STORY - SHUTDOWN AVERTED:  In a vote just after midnight Friday, the Senate voted to pass a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, averting a government shutdown while paving the way for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections ... The House had approved its version Thursday in a bipartisan tally of 256-167. The Senate passed its bill 65-32. The sweeping deal, which will fund the government until September, increases military and domestic programs, delivering federal funds throughout the country, but exceeds budget caps -- adding about a $1 trillion to the national debt. The bill will now head to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature or veto.DEMS FRET OVER 'EXTREME' JOHN BOLTON AS TRUMP'S NEW SECURITY ADVISER: President Donald Trump announced Thursday that former United Nations Amb. John Bolton will replace Gen. H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser effective April 9 -- the latest in a growing list of White House staff shakeups over the past year ... The president’s announcement came after months of speculation over whether McMaster would resign or be fired. Bolton told Fox News' “The Story” Thursday evening, “I didn't really expect that announcement this afternoon, but it's obviously a great honor. It's always an honor to serve our country and I think particularly in these times internationally, it's a particular honor.” Democrats wasted no time criticizing Trump's hiring of Bolton, a strong supporter of the Iraq war and an advocate for aggressive use of American power in foreign policy. “Mr. Bolton’s tendency to try to solve every geopolitical problem with the American military first is a troubling one,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “I hope he will temper his instinct to commit the men and women of our armed forces to conflicts around the globe, when we need to be focused on building the middle class here at home.” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted that Bolton “was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.”MASSIVE ANTI-GUN VIOLENCE PROTESTS EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND: Nearly 1 million people are expected in Washington Saturday for the ""March for Our Lives"" gun control rally and more than 800 sister marches from California to Japan ... In the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school massacre that killed 17, teen activists have pulled all-nighters, scheduling speakers, petitioning city councils, renting stages and walking march routes with police in a grass-roots movement that has raised more than $4 million. Students are expected to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue during the March for Our Lives on Saturday alongside pop stars Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato. Several student organizers have become mainstays on national TV, promoting the marches, and they landed on the cover of Time magazine. Oprah Winfrey and George and Amal Clooney have each donated $500,000. The cast of ""Modern Family"" did a public service announcement, and Broadway stars Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt recorded a song for the march.The Hollywood firepower behind these marches has prompted some critics to wonder whether liberals have taken advantage of the Parkland tragedy and vulnerable teens and are using them for their anti-gun agenda. ""They like to believe we're puppets, they like to believe that we're being controlled by someone else because ... they don't want to believe that human beings have this power because if they have this power then they might not need a gun,"" Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Ryan Deitsch told the Associated Press. WALL STREET JITTERY OVER POTENTIAL U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR: Wall Street will be watched closely Friday following U.S. stocks' heavy losses Thursday after President Trump announced he would impose tariffs on China ... The Dow lost 724.42 points, or 2.93 percent, slipping to 23,957.89. The S&P 500 dropped 68.24 points, or 2.52 percent, to 2,643.69. The Nasdaq Composite fell 178.61 points, or 2.43 percent, to 7,166.68. According to Trump, the tariffs on China could be as high as $60 billion, while United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and the president’s chief trade advisor, Peter Navarro, told reporters in a briefing that they will be $50 billion. In retaliation, China announced plans to impose tariffs on $3 billion in U.S. products such as steel, pork and wine. China also expects to take legal action against the U.S. through the World Trade Organization, the country’s Commerce Ministry said.EX-BRITISH SPY BEHIND TRUMP-RUSSIA DOSSIER FACING HOT SEAT: New details have emerged about questions that former British spy Christopher Steele may be asked regarding the unverified Trump-Russia dossier during his upcoming court-ordered deposition in London ... Fox News has obtained and reviewed British court records filed Wednesday in the ongoing multimillion-dollar civil suit brought by Russian tech guru Aleksej Gubarev against BuzzFeed and Steele that is underway in courtrooms on both sides of the Atlantic. Evan Fray-Witzer, a Boston-based attorney for Gubarev, told Fox News in an email, ""We expect that Mr. Steele will confirm that the allegations concerning Mr. Gubarev were unsolicited and that he included them in the dossier despite having done nothing to verify whether the allegations were true or not.""In London, the Steele deposition could last up to seven hours, something he has gone to great lengths and legal expense to avoid. Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have recommended a criminal referral of Steele to the Justice Department. AS SEEN ON FOX NEWS'COLLUSION' BETWEEN THE LEFT AND BIG COMPANIES: ""The ideological gap between the leaders of America's most powerful corporations and, say, the Democratic Party is basically nonexistent.

                                The cornerstone gun-rights decision, Heller v. D.C., the case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights is indeed an individual right, has reached its 10th anniversary.Over the last decade this decision has helped to propel a cultural shift on how guns are viewed in America. Its ramifications have boosted freedom in too many states and in too many ways to list. Nevertheless, its affects are misunderstood.Given the way that much of the media treats issues related to guns, and given that Heller and the subsequent McDonald decisions were 5-4 votes by the high court (a divide the court likely still holds today), it might seem like common sense to think America is closely divided on this issue.This is the view CNN, The Washington Post and more are pushing. The left sees the public’s acceptance of gun bans and other gun controls as slow but inevitable social change. They think it will follow the same type of public opinion shift that the gay-marriage issue went through.They are wrong because in this case they are doing the illiberal thing; they are trying to reduce rights and to undo long-held American freedom.If the left was right about even some of their talking points on guns and violence they might have a chance of deceiving a majority of Americans into voting away their freedom, but they aren’t.The number of homicides in the U.S. has fallen precipitously in America over the last half century as the number of firearms in civilian hands has risen. Most murders today occur in the areas with the strictest gun-control laws.The left has also gone way off the factual rails in its quest to ban so-called “assault weapons.” (I say so-called because there is no definition for “assault weapon” outside of how a particular law defines them.)In 2000 Al Gore found he miscalculated when he made gun control a central plank in his push for the presidency. It was a position that arguably cost him his home state and with it the election. Hillary Clinton made the same mistake, costing her votes in Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest.As they demonize “scary looking” semiautomatic rifles they miss the basic fact that year after year the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting finds that rifles of all types are used in less than 3 percent of murders.The anti-gun left also avoids addressing the basic fact that AR-15-type rifles have been sold to U.S. citizens since 1963, the same year the U.S. military adopted the M16. Meanwhile, “mainstream news” reporters don’t know or they won’t report the fact that semiautomatic rifles have been sold to sportsmen and more since the very early 20th century by companies like Remington and Winchester.Clearly the problem that a few terrorists and some mentally ill people are attempting, and at times succeeding, to accomplish mass murder isn’t the fault of rifles—or of vans and trucks for that matter—but is a more complex problem we need to focus in on to solve as best we can.The left isn’t even right about the so-called “gun lobby.”The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for firearms manufacturers (full disclosure: I’ve done some contract work for the NSSF), spends a lot of time and resources advocating for gun-safety programs. (I’m not using the term “gun safety” as loosely as gun-control proponents do today, as they use it as a synonym for “gun control”; instead, I am using it as the dictionary defines the terms.)The NSSF has joined the National Safety Council’s designation of June as “National Safety Month,” for example, by promoting its “Project Childsafe,” its “Own It? Respect it. Secure it.” program and other initiatives to try to further reduce accidents and other deaths related to firearms. Such efforts have been working, as the number of accidental deaths is a fraction of what it once was.People have noticed all this and vote accordingly.In 2000 Al Gore found he miscalculated when he made gun control a central plank in his push for the presidency. It was a position that arguably cost him his home state and with it the election. Hillary Clinton made the same mistake, which cost her blue collar votes in Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest.Now a decade after the Heller decision pro-gun laws have swept through many states. A dozen states now even have “constitutional” or “permitless” carry for handguns. There are over 100 million gun owners in America and more than 16 million people have permits to carry concealed handguns (up from about 1 million in the mid-1980s). A recent United Nations’ Small Arms Survey found that American civilians now have 393 million firearms (46 percent of all of the guns in civilian hands in the world).Clearly more and more Americans are taking their Second Amendment rights into their own hands.So no, the cultural shift isn’t toward gun control. It is clearly moving toward greater freedom. Frank Miniter is author of ""The Future of the Gun"" & ""The Ultimate Man’s Survival Guide"".

51,"Trace Gallagher reports on the aftermath of Stephen Paddock's attack on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.Within hours of the horrible attack in Las Vegas, before we knew most of the relevant facts about the tragedy, gun control advocates were calling for more gun control.  Here is something I would like those advocates to consider: Europe, which has all the gun controls that are being pushed in the aftermath of the Las Vegas carnage, has actually suffered more bloodshed from these types of attacks than the U.S.You heard that right: Countries such as France may have made all semi-automatic guns illegal, but that hasn’t stopped killers from getting fully automatic machine guns to use in mass shooting attacks. All four of the 2015 mass public shooting in France involved machine guns, including the 130 people killed in November of that year in multiple attacks including one at a concert venue.In the 1970s, 80s and 90s, Europe saw machine gun attacks in airports and nightclubs by groups such as Black September and the Red Army Faction. In fact, machine guns are commonly used in mass shootings in the rest of the world.This has not been the case here in the U.S. In fact, Sunday’s attack on a country music festival in Las Vegas – that left at least 58 people dead and more than 500 wounded – may be the first mass public shooting in the U.S. involving a machine gun, if it turns out the killer did use such a weapon. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, is believed to have used at least one fully automatic weapon – weapons that are heavily restricted under U.S. federal law.It is an attack that is likely to rank 14th in the most deadly mass public shooting in the world since 1970. It is the worst ever in the United States, according to data collected by the Center for Crime Research where I am founder and president.There were 29 such shootings (four or more fatalities in a public place, according to the FBI’s official definition) in the U.S. during the eight years of the Obama administration; 26 in Europe. The rate at which people are killed is virtually the same in the European Union as in the United States.Again, many of the facts about what happened in Las Vegas remain unknown at the moment, including exactly what type of firearm the gunman used. But one sad fact that everyone calling for gun control needs to consider is that, as Europe has shown, you can have all the gun control laws you want and you still won’t be able to stop horrors like this from happening.John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com. He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission. Lott is also a leading expert on guns and op-eds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center. He is the author of nine books including ""More Guns, Less Crime.""

52,"Kevin Corke has more on the latest developments out of the White House.President Trump is signaling an openness to the idea of raising the minimum age for purchasing certain firearms in the wake of last week’s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., where a 19-year-old is accused of killing 17 teachers and students with an AR-15 rifle.A White House source told Fox News that Trump is open to a number of measures to address mass shootings, including supporting a rise in the minimum age for owning certain firearms – a proposal that could face resistance from gun rights groups, like the National Rifle Association.According to the Giffords Law Center, which tracks gun laws and advocates for more restrictions, licensed firearm dealers under federal law cannot sell handguns to people under 21 and cannot sell long guns to people under 18. Some state laws already impose stricter minimum age requirements.It’s not clear if Trump would seek changes to federal laws, the source said, or if he would advocate for a change at the state level.The Washington Post reported that Trump is considering arguments that the minimum age for buying any semiautomatic weapon should be raised from 18 to 21. Axios also reported that Trump has been telling associates that he “doesn’t think high school kids should be able to buy guns.”During Tuesday’s White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about raising the age for buying AR-15s and said, “I think that's certainly something that's on the table for us to discuss, and that we expect to come up over the next couple of weeks.”She said the administration is working to determine what can be done at the federal level.“I know there are currently laws in place in certain states that restrict that,” she said. “In terms of whether or not we make that federal policy, that hasn't yet been determined.""TRUMP URGES BAN ON ‘BUMP STOCKS’The NRA has not yet publicly commented on the trial balloon. But the discussion could be a test for Trump’s loyal base, as many of his supporters generally oppose new restrictions that would affect law-abiding gun owners. Yet Trump has flouted traditional conservative positions in the past, and could be testing whether he could sway certain wings of the party. At the same time, he may be wary of going too far. The talks come as the NRA’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, is expected to address conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington this week.Trump, who was backed by the NRA during the 2016 election, has expressed support for the Second Amendment and said he’s against reflexive gun control measures that wouldn’t stop tragedies.But since last week’s shooting, the president has begun to embrace new gun restrictions.Trump on Tuesday directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft new regulations to ban firearm modifiers including the “bump stock” used in the Las Vegas massacre.A memo, released by the White House on Tuesday, directs the DOJ to propose a rule “banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.”Sanders said the White House hasn’t “closed the door on any front” when it comes to trying to stop mass shootings and said Trump supports efforts to improve the federal background system.Trump on Tuesday tweeted, “Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!”Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!The president on Wednesday is hosting parents, teachers and students at the White House to discuss efforts to ensure safety at schools. Among those attending will be members of the Parkland community and those affected by the Sandy Hook and Columbine school shootings, the White House said.Fox News’ John Roberts contributed to this report.Alex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

53,"California has faced a number of setbacks in implementing the state's latest gun-control measures, causing a number of deadlines to be pushed back and leaving some measures in legal limbo.After passing laws that expand the definition of ""assault weapon"" and make it illegal to possess gun magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, the state is facing myriad problems in trying to enforce the new laws. The first trouble came when the California Department of Justice (DOJ) attempted to draft their plan to register all of the rifles in California which have ""bullet button"" reloading devices and other rifles that would fall under the state's expanded assault weapons ban. On June 26, the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) determined that the DOJ had improperly sought to avoid the public comment period on the plan. That caused the deadline for registration to be pushed back six months.Then, on June 29, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of the state's gun magazine confiscation plan.""The regulation is neither presumptively legal nor longstanding,"" U.S. District Judge Roger T. Benitez said in his ruling. ""The statute hits close to the core of the Second Amendment and is more than a slight burden. When the simple test of Heller is applied, a test that persons of common intelligence can understand, the statute is adjudged an unconstitutional abridgment.""Another troubled part of California's new gun-control regime is a plan to require all ammunition sales be done through specially licensed dealers. By July 1 those who wanted to apply for the license to sell ammunition were supposed to be able to apply online, and the DOJ was supposed to have an online database of licensed dealers up and running. Neither the online license application portal nor the seller database were up and the regulations governing the licensing process were just made public on Monday. That means the process will likely take several more months to complete despite the fact that it will be illegal to purchase ammunition from anyone without the currently nonexistent ammunition dealer license on January 1, 2018.Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon. ",0
54,"In nearly 3,000 protests nationwide, students across the country walked out of their classrooms to take a stand against gun violence one month after the Parkland, Florida shooting.Just days after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people, students-turned-activists echoed the words “never again” and “not one more,” pushing lawmakers for increased gun control and better school safety.Many of the Parkland students, who have primarily taken to social media to champion these issues, have met with President Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., among others to demand action.One shooting survivor Cameron Kasky, a junior at the high school, wrote an op-ed about his experience, demanding Congress to take action.Other Parkland shooting survivors have organized events.In addition to the 17-minute National School Walkout on March 14, which honored those killed in the massacre and protested gun violence, student activists planned a march in Washington, D.C. called a “March for Our Lives.”Ahead of the event, here’s what you need to know.The march is slated to take place on Saturday, March 24, around 12 p.m., organizers said. The primary march will take place in Washington, D.C. on Pennsylvania Avenue between 3rd and 12th street NW, according to the March for Our Lives website.Initially, organizers wanted to hold the event on the National Mall, but were forced to choose another location because their request conflicted with a film crew’s permit, the Washington Post reported.Many other cities -- such as Portland, Oregon; Boise, Idaho; Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, Dallas and Chicago, among hundreds of other places -- are holding “sister marches.” Overall, there are more than 800 sibling marches across the country, organizers said. To see if your city is holding a march, you can check here.An opportunity for unity “This is such a unifying experience, it’s truly nonpartisan” said Ellie Boan, 19, a freshman at the University of South Carolina. She plans to attend a sister march in Columbia on March 24.“Not everyone necessarily agrees how [gun reform] should happen. But different viewpoints are coming together and all agree that no American child should feel unsafe in school,” she said.  For Boan, who has been working with local high schools and student organizations on her campus to help organize the event, the shooting itself  “doesn’t get anymore close to home.”Boan is originally from Parkland, Fla. While she didn’t attend Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, her older brother did. On top of that, her parents’ home is “just five minutes away from the school” where the Valentine's Day mass shooting unfolded.“I was on the phone with my mom during the shooting,” she said, adding that helicopters heading toward the high school could be heard in the call's background. “[Parkland] was the last place in America I ever expected for this to happen,” she said. Once known for its picturesque golf courses and safety, Boan added, the city will now be remembered as the site of one of the “biggest mass shootings in U.S. history.”Shortly after the suspected shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was identified, Boan had a chilling realization: She knew him, albeit not well.“His name sounded familiar, even though I didn’t want it to,"" she said.At that moment, Boan realized that she and he had attended the same middle school.“He even had a presence back then,” she said.Coming to that realization was the “most difficult thing to deal with,"" Boan said. ""I knew someone who was capable to inflict that kind of damage.""But Boan has since channeled her emotions -- which have ranged from sadness to fear to anger -- into activism.“I wanted to do something even though I couldn’t be there [Parkland],” she said.Participating in the march later this month is the “most effective way to process what I was going through,” she added. “Students are directly telling legislators what they want to be done. I hope that continues.”Adults are listeningPerry Bradley, founder and executive director of Building Better Communities, a community outreach organization in South Carolina, is helping organize the sister march in Columbia that will end on the steps of the city’s statehouse.Students, local lawmakers and state representatives are slated to speak at the event.“Parkland opened our eyes,” Bradley told Fox News. “Adults are embracing what kids have to say [about gun reform].”A bipartisan cause“I think that we have finally reached a breaking point in America,” 21-year-old Antwon Stephens, who plans to participate in a sister march in Atlanta, told Fox News. “Both sides are tired of the answer being nothing.”Stephens, who said he comes from a family who “firmly believes in the Second Amendment,” echoed Boan -- he also thinks the March for Our Lives movement presents an opportunity for unity, adding that both sides of the political aisle should work in a “non-partisan way” to understand “why things like this keep happening.”“I think it is going to take a whole lot of elbow grease to keep this movement going strong,” he said. “But this movement is most powerful because it’s led by students.”For family and the future“I was numb. I was in shock for three days after I heard about the shooting,” said Jennia Taylor, a senior at Spelman College who also plans to attend a sister march in Atlanta.Hailing from Parkland, Florida, the shooting greatly impacted Taylor not only because it occured in her hometown, but also because the 21-year-old is a 2014 graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, she told Fox News.“[Stoneman Douglas] is a big family; it was like hearing that someone invaded your home,” Taylor said, who added that she first found out about the massacre through her family’s group chat.“I lived there in high school,” she said. “I saw my teachers and coaches more than I saw my parents.”The day of the shooting, hearing about students and faculty who had been injured or killed affected Taylor the most, she said. It was also unnerving, she added, because Taylor’s younger cousin is a freshman at the school.She was also worried for her former classmates as well, as many of them have younger siblings or family members who are current students at the high school, she said.“We all kind of know each other, she said. “It’s so intertwined, it’s kind of crazy.”Taylor’s heart sank when she heard that Aaron Feis, a beloved football coach at Stoneman Douglas, had been shot and killed shielding students from a rain of bullets.Taylor’s two brothers, also graduates of Stoneman Douglas, played football at the school and her family was well acquainted with Feis. As a result, the loss hit her hard.“It’s really hard for my family knowing him, and knowing his family,” she said.As for her participation in the March for Our Lives, Taylor said she’s excited to “see people from all walks of life who have been affected by gun violence come together and march for a purpose,” she said. “[They’re] putting opinions aside to make sure we have a safe community and safe society.”“I’m going to grow up and have kids. I don’t want to fear that every time they leave they’re going to get shot,” she said. “After it happened in my hometown, I realized that it’s time to take action.”The National Park Service told the Washington Post that at least 500,000 people are expected to attend the march in D.C. alone.The event, which is being organized and led by Stoneman Douglas students and shooting survivors Emma González, Cameron Kasky, among others, is mainly funded through donations.Kasky created a GoFundMe page to help pay for the event, raising more than $3.3 million in a month.""Half of the funds raised on this GoFundMe will go toward the March For Our Lives Action Fund,"" Kasky explained on the fundraising page. ""The other half of the funding raised on this GoFundMe will provide relief and financial support to the victims and families of the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School via the Broward Education Foundation.""Celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney and Oprah have donated $500,000 to the event, as have Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Deadline reported.George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’  These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, announced on March 9 that he also donated $500,000 to March for Our Lives.""I'm so inspired by all the conversations the Stoneman Douglas students are leading!"" he tweeted. I just did the same: $500,000 to @AMarch4OurLives. I’m so inspired by all the conversations the Stoneman Douglas students are leading! #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/fXMUsfHDDcEverytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, and Giffords, an anti-gun violence group that was started by former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, among other national organizations, are also working with march organizers -- either through donations or planning and logistics.“Students are making history and demanding that our elected officials protect them. Everytown is proud to help them make their voices heard on March 24, and we look forward to more Americans following their lead to forge meaningful change to our country’s gun laws,” John Feinblatt,  the president of Everytown, said in a statement after the organization announced its $2.5 million grant to support sister marches around the country.The ride-hailing company Lyft also announced that it will offer free rides to Stoneman Douglas students participating in the march.We're so excited to see @lyft's support of #MarchForOurLives! Thanks for marching with us 👊 pic.twitter.com/2B2P8OVTajAdditionally, many celebrities are supporting the event by performing at the march in D.C. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato, among others, are slated to perform at the rally.   The event is not a political one, organizers claim.“School safety is not a political issue,” a mission statement on the organization’s website reads. “There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing.”While the activists “support the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms, as set forth in the United States Constitution,” they also have a list of demands, urging members of Congress to pass laws to end the sale of high-capacity magazines, improve background checks and more safety measures.Madeline Farber is a Reporter for Fox News.

56,"Trump met with Democrats and Republicans about solutions for preventing mass shootings; Senator Joe Manchin says on 'Your World' that Trump supports common sense back ground check changes.This is a rush transcript from ""Your World,"" February 28, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.NEIL CAVUTO, ""YOUR WORLD"" HOST: I want to get the read from all this with Democrat Joe Manchin, of course, of West Virginia, and working to Pat Toomey to come up with a bipartisan arms measure.And I do know you have a vote to look forward to, Senator. So, I thank you for taking the time. SEN. JOE MANCHIN, D-WEST VIRGINIA: Sure, Neil. CAVUTO: How did it go in the White House there today, and do you think you made some common ground? I mean, if you had even approaching the support you had last time, you're very close to 60 votes. MANCHIN: Right, with the president's support.And here's thing. It comes down to this. I have always and will always support the Second Amendment rights. So does the president. And he knows we need to do some commonsense changes as far as in background checks. When people go to gun shows, they need to have a background check, it's a commercial transaction, on the Internet. He supports that. And I'm tickled to death. And with his support, and both of us protecting the Second Amendment rights, we can move forward. And that's what we intend to do. CAVUTO: Do you think, when you say intend to do it, that this could be done in short order? The president said keep it simple, don't do a lot of add-ons. There was talk about, even from Steve Scalise.MANCHIN: Yes. CAVUTO: Adding special measures for concealed weapons.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: What do you think of that?MANCHIN: Yes. He knew the controversial things that really have a heavy lift, if you will.CAVUTO: Right. MANCHIN: But when you're talking about the background checks, the Manchin- Toomey bill that we had in 2013, it was a good piece of legislation then, and it's a good piece of legislation now. That's the base bill he's talking about. It had the Fix NICS in there, so we have better reporting. He wants to put in the mental illness part. We can address that. School safety, we had that in there. There's some things that we can tweak and put in there. He said he's getting rid of bump stocks on his own. That doesn't need to be in there.He wants the age of 21. We will see if there's support for the age of 21.  It seems to me like it's a no-brainer, because if it takes 21 years of age to buy a handgun, then he's talking about AR-15s. If he just -- if they basically narrow that down to what firearm he's talking about to raising the age, because there's an awful lot of 18-year-olds who hunt and use for target practicing, sport shooting and all that, and very responsible. So, we will work through that.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: But are you against raising the age? He noticed that difference between 21 for a gun, 18 for some of these...MANCHIN: No, I think -- I think that's a no-brainer for me. I don't have a problem there. CAVUTO: OK. MANCHIN: But, also, there might be a caveat where we can carve out, which is what you do when you compromise, that if a person at 18 years of age wishes to have an AR-15 and it's legally sold, then that person would have to go certain types of steps and tests and competency, showing that they're adequately trained and responsible to use this type of a weapon. So that could be done. But we have heard talk of that. We're willing to talk to anybody about whatever they want to, to come up with an all- inclusive piece of legislation. So, the Manchin-Toomey bill we had will be the base we will work off on. John Cornyn and Chris Murphy and everybody that wants to work with us, hopefully, we can make one good piece of legislation that can get through. CAVUTO: As you might have heard, Senator, Hope Hicks, the communications director of the White House, is resigning. MANCHIN: Yes, I did.CAVUTO: Obviously, it occurs at a very unique and critical moment here, to communicate the message on getting all this out that you want to get out. What do you think of what is going on at the White House right now? MANCHIN: I really -- I was just there. And I met afterwards, Pat and I and John Cornyn, and went into the room with the president. And Mr. Kelly, General Kelly was there, and talking about how we move forward and we will work together and we want to make sure the president is on board. And I said, if the president is on board, knowing that he's going to protect the Second Amendment, the same as I am going to protect it, and Pat Toomey and everybody else, we can get something rational reasonably done. CAVUTO: Was Hope Hicks there when you were there by any chance? (CROSSTALK)MANCHIN: No, she wasn't. (CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Because she would have communicated that. MANCHIN: I didn't see her there. No, I did not.So, I just heard about this walking in. This is the first time I have heard about it. CAVUTO: Yes. All on the same day, as you know, Senator, the president and his attorney general are at loggerheads again. What do you think of that? MANCHIN: Well, there's a lot going on. It's a lot to digest, I understand. But it seems like they -- this is the modus operandi. This is how they operate. And he's able to function through that. So, everyone has their own style and their own comfort level. CAVUTO: You sound surprised. MANCHIN: A little bit unusual. CAVUTO: Yes. Your colleagues and what they make of all of this,. How willing are they to help out on a gun measure, particularly Democrats who might think that Republicans are not giving up enough on gun control, per se? You would tell them what? MANCHIN: I would say this. And I have said this before. I know they wanted to go much further than what my bill and Toomey's bill went in 2013. But we have to bring people together to get 60 votes. It's the art of the compromise working in the Senate. And we have a piece of legislation. And I have said this very candidly. If President Trump would have been president in 2013, when this piece of legislation was first introduced, we wouldn't be having this conversation. We would have passed it.Because of President Obama, people are a little bit concerned, and they were believing that he wouldn't protect their Second Amendment rights or wasn't as supportive of the Second Amendment rights as hard as they wanted it to be.They were scared, well, if you pass this one, Joe, even though it makes sense, we're gun owners, we like it, it's OK, we think it makes sense. But if we do that, then they will do more. He will take more. They don't believe that with President Trump. And that's why it's important to have his support. CAVUTO: Senator Manchin, thank you very, very much. MANCHIN: Thank you, Neil. Appreciate it. CAVUTO: Know it's been a busy day for you. Thank you. MANCHIN: Sure thing. Bye-bye.CAVUTO: All right.

                                Vermont Gov. Phil Scott may put the brakes on his stock car racing hobby over concerns that his presence at the track will anger fans who disagree with his support for new gun control measures in the state.The 59-year-old Republican approved legislation this month that banned high capacity magazines and bump stocks, raised the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21 and mandated background checks for most firearms transactions.The new regulations were drawn up in the wake of an alleged threat to shoot up a high school by an 18-year-old former student that was uncovered earlier this year. Several of the most serious charges against the teen, Jack Sawyer, were dropped this week.Scott has been one of the top drivers at Thunder Road Speedbowl in Barre for years, and continued racing after he became governor in 2017.The Vermont politician understands that many of the spectators are also hunters and gun owners. His spokeswoman says he’s talking to the track’s owners and other drivers to determine if his being there will have a negative effect on the event, but that he hasn’t yet made a decision.Scott (14) has been a regular at the quarter-mile oval for decades.

Before the facts were even known about Wednesday morning’s 7 AM shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, gun control advocates were already calling for more stringent laws. ■ David Frum, senior editor for the Atlantic, called for background checks, gun licensing and registration, long gun permits, limits on magazine size, and restrictions on open carrying of guns.■ Windsor Mann, a columnist for USA Today, blamed “easy access to deadly weapons.”■ Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe blamed the attack on “too many guns” and immediately called for more gun control.Police investigate a shooting scene after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice near Washington in Alexandria, Virginia, June 14, 2017.

We don’t even know yet whether these laws could conceivably have made any difference in preventing this attack. And Frum is already correcting his posts for misstating Virginia’s gun control laws.After each mass public shooting, President Obama would call for expanded background checks on private transfers of guns  — even though not one of the shootings would have been prevented by such a law.  Indeed, not a single attack since at least 2000 would have been stopped.“News” coverage of these events also shows the same knee-jerk biases for more gun control.  Guns are often referred to as “assault weapons” even if they function exactly the same as a hunting rifle.  Nowhere do the news reports mention whether an attack occurred in a gun-free zone. They never examine the thought process of attackers who want defenseless victims.Reportedly using a large capacity magazine, shooter James Hodgkinson may already have been in violation of Virginia law.  Virginia state law prohibits carrying of a “semi-automatic center-fire rifle . . . with a magazine that will hold more than 20 rounds.”  Hodgkinson and the Capitol police may have together fired between 50 and 70 rounds.Police man a shooting scene after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice near Washington in Alexandria, Virginia, June 14, 2017. 
                        
                             (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)
One thing is clear.  As Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Mich., told WWJ radio in Detroit, “The only reason—the only reason—why any of us walked out of this thing: By the grace of God, one of the folks here had a weapon to fire back and give us a moment to find cover. Because we were inside the backstop and if we didn’t have that cover by a brave person who stood up and took a shot themselves, we would not have gotten out of there and every one of us would have been hit. Every single one of us.”It is a lesson that we have seen over and over again.  The longer that it takes for a good guy with a gun to arrive on the scene, the greater the carnage.Since only congressional leadership has personal security, Fox News anchor Jon Scott speculated today that the shooter “did not expect someone to return fire.”Again and again, we see shooters seeking out defenseless victims. Last year, a young ISIS sympathizer planned a shooting at one of the largest churches in Detroit. An FBI wire recorded him explaining why he had targeted the church: “It’s easy, and a lot of people go there. Plus people are not allowed to carry guns in church. Plus it would make the news.” Fortunately, that ISIS sympathizer was turned in by his father. But during the last couple of years, shooters have made similar statements after attacking a church in Charleston, S.C., a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and a sorority house in Santa Barbara.In their desire for decisive action, people often don't stop to consider that gun control proposals may do more harm than good.  Gov. Terry McAuliffe thinks that the problem is the presence of guns, but the plain truth is that every single place in the world with gun bans has seen an increase in murder rates.  One would think that at least one place would see its murder rates stay the same or even fall.  But there have been no exceptions.  That's because law-abiding citizens obey gun control laws while killers don’t.  Bans end up making attacks easier.During the Obama administration, Europe experienced higher casualty rates from mass public shootings than did the U.S.  Despite having bans even on guns that fire one bullet at a time, France, Belgium, the U.K., and Spain all experienced attacks with machine guns or bombs.There’s been a lot of talk about prohibiting guns with large-capacity ammunition magazines.  But a gun that can hold a magazine, be it a handgun or a rifle, can hold a magazine of any size. A magazine, which is basically a metal box with a spring, is very easy to make and virtually impossible to stop criminals from obtaining. Legislation in 1994 banned magazines holding more than 10 bullets, but it had no effect on crime rates.My research shows that the deadliest mass public shootings don’t even involve large capacity magazines.In March 2013, 86 percent of police officers surveyed by PoliceOne, the 450,000-member private organization of police, said that casualties would have been prevented if legally-armed citizens had been able to carry guns in places such as Newtown and Aurora.Fortunately, the heroic actions of the Capitol police kept any of the shooter’s victims from being killed.  The Alexandria police arrived quickly, reportedly in about 3 minutes, but the attack today shows yet again how important it is for someone to be on the scene quickly with a gun. John R. Lott, Jr. is a columnist for FoxNews.com. He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission. Lott is also a leading expert on guns and op-eds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center. He is the author of nine books including ""More Guns, Less Crime.""

                                Amid a barrage of taunts from protesters calling him a ""liar"" and a ""traitor,"" Vermont Gov. Phil Scott enacted the state's first major gun control measures during a signing ceremony at the Statehouse on Wednesday. The package of bills raises the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21, bans high-capacity magazines, and makes it easier to take guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others and from people arrested or cited for domestic assault.Under the new rules, people younger than 21 can buy a firearm only if they have completed a hunter safety course. The legislation also requires background checks for most private gun sales and bans rapid-fire devices known as bump stocks.Scott, a first-term Republican, said the recent arrest of a former student allegedly planning a mass shooting at a Vermont high school, as well as the deadly massacre at a Florida high school in February that left 17 dead, spurred him to action.But at several points, he had some trouble getting that message out.""On Feb. 16, I was in my office — "" Scott said, before a protester interrupted: ""Smoking a joint?""""— preparing for the day ahead, when everything changed,"" Scott continued, according to the Burlington Free Press.

""It's a responsibility I take very seriously as governor.""Then came a pointed taunt amid the applause: ""Unlike following the Constitution.""The new rules will take effect at various points this year, with some going into force immediately. Residents who had already purchased high-capacity magazines can keep them -- which had led to some stocking up on rifle magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and pistol magazines that hold more than 15, according to local reports.Vermont’s constitution protects a person’s right to bear arms to defend themselves and the state, providing additional protection over and above the U.S. Constitution's provisions and associated case law. Gun rights groups in the state have vowed to challenge the new restrictions.“I’ve been working on this issue for several years and wanted to come and thank Gov. Scott.""

69,"President praised for being tough on illegal possession while respecting rights of law-abiding ownersAndrew Turner suffers from partial paralysis in his dominant hand, the legacy of an injury to his right arm while on active duty in the Navy – which is why, according to court papers, the Maryland resident needs a semiautomatic gun to defend himself.The state’s 2013 Firearm Safety Act, however, bars the sale of semiautomatic rifles like the popular AR-15 and AK-47, and sets a 10-round limit on magazines. The law could be at the center of the next big precedent-setting gun case if the Supreme Court takes up a challenge from Turner and others.“We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will reverse this egregious decision,” Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. The Maryland law is one of a host of gun control measures passed in the wake of the 2012 Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre – and, if taken up, the case could have sweeping implications for like-minded states in the gun control debate. Jay Porter, an attorney for the plaintiffs, complained about a patchwork of rulings in the wake of the landmark 2008 Heller decision upholding the individual’s right to own a gun. He called on the Supreme Court to clear up the confusion. CALIF. STRUGGLES TO IMPLEMENT NEW GUN CONTROL MEASURES“We would like to see a reversal in the trend of the lower courts,” Porter said. “At best, there is a lot of confusion in the lower courts about the Second Amendment. At worst, lower courts are ignoring and resisting the Heller decision because they didn’t like the outcome. That resistance needs to be mediated.”In response to Newtown, 21 states passed some type of new gun control laws in 2013, according to a joint report by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign. Most didn’t deal directly with buying or owning a firearm, but rather with background checks, record-keeping rules for gun dealers and other factors.An AR-15 sits on a display case at the ""Ready Gunner"" gun store in Provo, Utah, in this June 21, 2016 file photo.

However, four states—California, Connecticut, Maryland and New York—passed or strengthened bans on semiautomatic weapons in 2013. Those same four states, as well as Colorado, passed or strengthened bans on high-capacity ammunition magazines.They were able to do so, in spite of the Heller decision, because of an interpretation that the 2008 ruling dealt largely with handguns, giving them leeway to restrict what critics call “assault rifles.”Until a court rules otherwise, this might be the last type of existing legal gun ban. ETHICS PANEL CLEARS DEM IN GUN SIT-INBut Turner, of Hyattsville, and lead plaintiff Stephen Kolbe of Towson, Md., along with gun stores and gun-rights groups, are suing to overturn the Maryland law. They are specifically disputing a lower court ruling that said the Second Amendment doesn’t apply to these guns.“Maryland has banned the most popular semiautomatic rifles and magazines—arms that are indisputably in common use for self-defense—from the homes of its law-abiding citizens,” the plaintiffs’ petition said.Maryland’s law was upheld in federal district court. Then a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond ruled 2-1 the law wasn’t constitutional.When Maryland appealed the decision to the full appeals court, a 10-4 majority determined, “[W]e have no power to extend Second Amendment protection to the weapons of war that the Heller decision explicitly excluded from such coverage.”The opinion went on to state, “At the same time, according to the state’s evidence, the FSA-banned assault weapons have been used disproportionately to their ownership in mass shootings and the murders of law enforcement officers.”In July, the plaintiffs appealed their case to the Supreme Court.Their petition noted that a 1989 report by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, described semiautomatic rifles as suitable for self-defense.“Heller struck down a prohibition on the firearms most commonly chosen for self-defense—handguns—even though handguns are arguably more ‘dangerous’ than other firearms, and even though firearms other than handguns remained available for use in self-defense,” the petition continued. “This court recognized and protected the principle at the heart of the interests enshrined by the Second Amendment: The individual – and not the government – retains the right to choose from among common arms those that they believe will best protect their person, family, and home.”For his part, Kolbe, a small business owner, first bought a semiautomatic handgun after an employee’s boyfriend threatened to kill her at work and police did not respond for 30 minutes, according to court documents.Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh’s office declined to weigh in on whether the Supreme Court would accept the case. “The court has not even decided to take the case at this point and our office does not want to get into speculation on consequences, particularly since this is ongoing litigation,” Frosh spokeswoman Raquel Coombs told Fox News in an email.After the 4th Circuit upheld the law in February, Frosh heralded the ruling.“It is unthinkable that these weapons of war, weapons that caused the carnage in Newtown and in other communities across the country, would be protected by the Second Amendment,” Frosh said in a February statement. Other states are watching the case closely.Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming all filed amicus briefs on behalf of the plaintiffs. Meanwhile, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Oregon, New York and the District of Columbia filed briefs on behalf of Maryland.The NRA also is backing the legal effort.“Lower courts have been making up their own rules when it comes to the Second Amendment for too long, and the Kolbe decision crossed yet another line,” Cox said in a statement.",0

“In reference to the tragedy in Las Vegas, we knew a lot of people there,” Hill said. “The doctors that (treated) the wounded, they saw wounds like you’d see in war. That’s not right.

72,"Effingham County board member David Campbell explains on 'Fox & Friends First.'Multiple rural Illinois counties have passed resolutions establishing a so-called “sanctuary” for gun owners in a bid to thwart the state legislature’s efforts to enact stricter gun control.At least five counties declared themselves sanctuary counties for gun rights, co-opting a word that most conservatives associate with the liberal policy of ignoring federal immigration laws.The resolutions aim to send a message to the Democratic-controlled Legislature in the state that if it passes the proposed gun bills, such as increasing the minimum age for owning a gun or a bump stock ban, the counties will instruct their employees to ignore the new laws.“It’s a buzzword, a word that really gets attention. With all these sanctuary cities, we just decided to turn it around to protect our Second Amendment rights,” said David Campbell, vice chairman of the Effingham County Board.“It’s a buzzword, a word that really gets attention. With all these sanctuary cities, we just decided to turn it around to protect our Second Amendment rights.""He added that around 20 other counties in Illinois have asked for copies of his county’s resolution. He also said officials in Oregon and Washington, have also asked for copies.County officials say it’s unlikely their symbolic move will be enough to stop the state legislators from passing new gun control measures as the legislature is dominated by lawmakers from in and around Chicago, a city with rampant gun crime.But it might be enough to make some lawmakers worried.“I don’t think you can say, ‘I don’t agree with the law so I won’t enforce it,’” said Kathleen Willis, a Democratic state representative from suburban Chicago who sponsored some of the gun legislation. “I think it sends the wrong message.”Bryan Kibler, the Effingham County’s top prosecutor, claims the resolutions passed by counties aren’t much different from cities such as Chicago which refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.By using the language of sanctuary states, the counties also draw attention to the rural-urban political divide in the state. The “downstate” areas of Illinois voted for Donald Trump while Chicago backed Hillary Clinton.“We’re just stealing the language that sanctuary cities use,” said Kibler. “We wanted to … get across that our Second Amendment rights are slowly being stripped away.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

75,"Massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida sparks new calls for gun control; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel.This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" February 15, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONN.: Mental health solutions are not going to stop gun violence. We need stronger gun violence prevention and background checks. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R-IOWA: We have not done a very good job of making sure that people that have mental reasons for not being able to handle a gun, getting their name into the FBI files. And we need to concentrate on that. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I'd rather pass gun safety legislation than win the election. GOV. RICK SCOTT, R-FLA.: We're going to find out what happened here, and what we're going to do is we're going to have a real conversation about how we're going to stop it. (END VIDEO CLIPS)BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: A lot of talk about action today after that horrible shooting in Florida yesterday, 17 killed. But what is real and what can potentially happen in the building behind us? Let's bring in our panel: Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano; Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at National Review; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of ""No Labels Radio"" on Sirius XM, and Jonathan Swan, national politics reporter for Axios.A.B., I'll start with you. What is real? You know, Nancy Pelosi says she would rather lose the election and pass something. But what's possible in this environment? A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Oh, I don't know what's possible because we've been here before. They didn't even get bump stocks legislation out after the NRA supported it last summer. We're not looking at a real opportunity here. Both sides continue to dig in. If you want to actually change this, you have to actually take away the weaponry with the ability to kill so many people so quickly. That infringes on one constitutional right. If you want to stop -- get in early and screen social media, you're infringing -- where people are describing these feelings and these plans and intentions of photographs and everything, you're taking away their constitutional expression of free speech. BAIER: We hear what the president says. But behind the scenes what is the administration thinking? Is there thinking about a policy push do you think? JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS: One adviser said to me that this is theoretically a Nixon-to-China opportunity. Trump is probably the only guy who could because he is so solid on this issue. The NRA supports him, he could actually go there. But I don't think Trump wants to go to China. This is an issue where he actually instinctively understands. He said it in speeches, he says, Common Core bad, Second Amendment good. And this is something that he has internalized. He's seen it on the campaign trail, he understands it. And there was nobody who supported him more strongly during the campaign than the NRA. So I don't see Trump acting against the NRA's interests on this issue. BAIER: Here's the president on making schools safer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Later this month I will be meeting with the nation's governors and attorney generals. We're making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference, we must actually make that difference. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Jonah?JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: I didn't get the audio in the first half, but I think he's right. But I should also say, you know, I agree with A.B. that we are in a political stalemate. And just the second this news broke, I think everybody who has to talk about these things professionally, their soul just got weighted down just at the prospect of the same arguments on both sides, which I think are valid arguments and important arguments and all the rest. But I do think because if there is a stalemate in the political system, that doesn't mean that the rest of society can't adjust to these things. There can be an Israeli style hardening of these schools. There are different tactics that people can take. I agree with A.B. that if the government gets involved, and using AI or something to monitor comments on the web, that gets into serious First Amendment issues, and we'll have him set his hair on fire. BAIER: Pointing to the judge next door. (LAUGHTER)GOLDBERG: But there are, you know -- this guy was saying, yes, he actually said in a YouTube comment section, I'm going to be a professional school shooter. BAIER: Right. GOLDBERG: That is a red flag. And it was sent to the FBI. BAIER: So let's play that, special agent talking about what happened there with the FBI. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT LASKY, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: In 2017, the FBI received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel. The comment simply said, ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" No other information was included with that comment, which would indicate a time, location, or the true identity of the person who made the comment. The FBI conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment. We do not know if it's the same person. (END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Judge? JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: I essentially agree with everything my colleagues have said. And my heart sank knowing that I was going to have to talk about this because it's such a tragedy. And I like the Israeli model. The school doors are locked and two or three of the teachers are trained to carry. You don't know which teachers they are. They do not carry openly. They carry silently and in a hidden way. And how many school killings are there in Israel? None. That all can be done by the Florida legislature. It does not require the Congress. Congress can't do anything. Congress can't pass a budget. Congress can't agree on DACA. We're going to talk about that in a little while. The president I agree with Jonathan is very much wedded to the NRA as is more than half the House of Representatives. That's a nonstarter. And there's this thing called the Second Amendment which they've all taken a note to uphold and the Supreme Court has interpreted as it has in a very pro- individual rights way. BAIER: Is the mental health push, you know, that talking about this something that they can get done with something else, and at least around the edges try to attack it? SWAN: Well, they've already passed some legislation, I think Paul Ryan pointed that out, the 21st century cures act that touches on mental health issues. I don't know because you're going to have the left saying this is just a smoke screen for the real issue, which is background checks. Everyone retreats to their camps immediately. And as A.B. was saying, it's very hard to see where that common ground is. BAIER: Look at this deal. He gets the AR-15 legally. He buys it legally. He passes the background check. I mean, something happened. STODDARD: And that is why the gun control side will argue that the background checks are not restrictive enough, that you are still permitted to buy a firearm when you -- BAIER: Have been expelled from -- STODDARD: -- had problems. And that they would argue that if you can't drink alcohol, why are you carrying an AR-15 around at age 18? GOLDBERG: I just want to point out, I know the NRA becomes the shorthand in these conversations. But the NRA, if you listen to some people on some other networks, they talk about how all these politicians are owned by the NRA and we talk about how Donald Trump is beholden to the NRA. The NRA actually doesn't give that much money into politics compared to a lot of other institutions. Their effectiveness is that they're -- and I'm critic of some of the things the NRA does, but their effectiveness is that they're actually organizing and communicating with actual voters. And that's what makes them so effective. BAIER: If you poll in these swing states, it's through the roof. That's not NRA, that's -- GOLDBERG: That's not the NRA. That's being beholden to the voters who get you elected. NAPOLITANO: I've got say that suggesting that this is a mental health issue is a diversion. It's an issue of not enough superior firepower to stop these killers. If he's crazy, he's going to find a way to kill. If he's irrational and wants to kill, he is going to find a way to kill. BAIER: There are 300 million guns. NAPOLITANO: Except in schools, like a sitting duck. SWAN: I was talking to a senior White House official about this today and they said, what are we going to do? There is, whatever, 320 million guns in this country. Are we going to do what my country did and try to buy them all back? It's not realistic. Again, I don't see this heading in a gun control direction.Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Not really. What would be daring is including a Parkland student with a different viewpoint on gun control up on that stage as well.Now, with David Hogg, he's just a kid, right? So the media says off-limits. But the Rubio thing? That was lame grandstanding. Is that too harsh to Mr. Hogg? Not really, because by criticizing him, I'm complementing him. He's now a revolutionary, like other well-organized and well-funded revolutionaries. Not challenging revolutionaries will be patronizing.But if you're asking me, the students of Parkland had a real gripe. A craven sheriff didn't do his job as well as an insane killer did his, so 17 people died. The students thought their school should be a safe space, not like the safe spaces of older college kids who weep at the hint of painful truths. But a real safe space protected from madmen and when necessary shielded by grown-ups with guns.The same goals of sensible students should not be ignored by the NRA. But if the other truth is ignored by parents, well, go on blaming guns for acts of evil instead of actual evildoers. And in four years, you'll end up with cowering undergrads majoring only in sanctimony and sign-making.Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).

85,"'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on Washington's change of tone regarding gun control, especially from the NRA suggesting stricter guidelines on 'bump stock' purchases.If there is one issue on which Congress has been utterly gridlocked, despite one mass shooting after another, it is guns.The country goes through the same paralyzing debate over and over, with Democrats demanding gun control and Republicans and the NRA insisting that guns are not the problem.Now, in the wake of Las Vegas, that may be changing in one modest way.Consider this comment from the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn: ""I own a lot of guns, and as a hunter and sportsman, I think that's our right as Americans, but I don’t understand the use of this bump stock.""The Texas lawmaker is referring to an easily available $200 device used by the Las Vegas shooter to make semiautomatic weapons, which are legal, fire more like automatic weapons. And he says some colleagues agree with him. Paul Ryan called it ""something that we need to look into.""And this is a bombshell that could change the equation: the NRA said yesterday that it believes these devices should be subject to ""additional regulation."" The Obama administration approved their use in 2010.President Trump, who campaigned as a champion of the Second Amendment, said that ""we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by,"" and Sarah Huckabee Sanders says he's ""open"" to discussing bump stocks.A Wall Street Journal editorial page on ""The Gun Control Mirage"" says the paper isn’t opposed to banning bump stocks or adopting stricter background checks, but ""no one should think these will stop a determined killer.""It’s entirely possible that nothing may happen. A number of Republicans say they're opposed to any legislative changes. But the sheer horror of death raining down from a Vegas high-rise hotel seems at least to have changed the atmosphere. The Washington Post notes the history of failure: ""It didn’t work after mass shootings at a nightclub in Orlando, college campuses in Virginia and Oregon, a church in Charleston, or at a movie theater and high school in Colorado. Or after two lawmakers survived assassination attempts. But after a gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 at a Las Vegas concert, Democrats are going to try again to revamp the nation’s gun laws."" The New York Times puts it this way: ""Top congressional Republicans, who have for decades resisted any legislative limits on guns, signaled on Wednesday that they would be open to banning the firearm accessory that the Las Vegas gunman used to transform his rifles to mimic automatic weapon fire."" The argument for banning the bump stocks is that keeps up with changing technology and prevents people from owning something similar to an illegal automatic weapon. At the same time, none of the background-check proposals would have stopped the Las Vegas shooter, who had no criminal record and legally bought 33 guns over the past year.The last real gun control measure passed in 1994, when Bill Clinton pushed through a ban on so-called assault weapons and large magazine purchases. The law was blamed for a number of Democratic members of Congress losing their seats that fall, and the party made little push to preserve it when it expired a decade later.Dianne Feinstein, whose daughter decided at the last minute not to attend the country music concert where the slaughter took place, is now pushing the bump stocks measure. She became San Francisco mayor in 1978 when the incumbent, George Moscone, was assassinated.On the other hand, Steve Scalise, who barely survived a July shooting at a baseball practice, told the Post: ""I think it’s a shame that the day somebody hears about a shooting, the first thing they think about is, how can I go promote my gun-control agenda, as opposed to saying, how do I go pray and help the families that are suffering?""The country is desperate to stop these mass shootings that have become an increasingly common feature of American life. No piece of legislation can fully accomplish that goal, but Congress is talking about taking a step in that direction for the first time in two decades.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of ""MediaBuzz"" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

86,"The debate hits close to home with members of both parties nearly killed six years apart; Mike Emanuel has the story for 'Special Report.'It’s what congressional Democrats didn’t do in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre.Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., didn’t commandeer the Senate floor for 14 hours and 50 minutes in a filibuster about gun violence.House Democrats didn’t occupy the floor for more than 24 hours, staging a sit-in to protest the GOP leadership refusing to bring gun legislation to a vote.Instead, Democrats reverted to what they usually do after a mass shooting.They held press conferences about guns. And they gave floor speeches about mass violence -- following the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday night in which 59 people were killed and at least 515 others were injured.Democrats also made calls for bills to enhance background checks, curb heavy-duty ammo and restrict high-capacity weapons. On Wednesday morning, Democrats will rally on the House steps for legislation to prevent gun violence and mourn the dead in Las Vegas.Republicans have said very little so far.In the wake of the hell unleashed from the 32nd floor, of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Democrats defaulted to a time-honored, yet futile script on firearms in the wake of a mass shooting.Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill on October 3 to demand Congress' immediate action to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre.
								
									 (Reuters)
Democrats again pined for gun control legislation -- prepared to get really nowhere. It doesn’t matter if it’s Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Colo., Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Orlando or Las Vegas. Congress likely won’t take the kind of action Democrats demand on firearms.Consider this: if Congress didn’t act after separate mass shootings that nearly killed former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., why would there be movement now?Now, back to the filibuster and the sit-in last June just days following the assault at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.Murphy -- shaken by Sandy Hook in 2012 -- crystallized new energy on the Democrats’ cause with his filibuster.“I hope this means something,” he said moments after his lengthy oratory.A week later, Democrats broke new ground in their demonstration methods. Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and John Larson, D-Conn., orchestrated the sit-in. That prompted the House to create new rules to sanction lawmakers for future protests.Both the filibuster and sit-in were revolutionary in the Democrats’ push for gun legislation. But their dissent yielded no progress.After Las Vegas, Democrats are bereft of revolutionary ideas to galvanize the cause.“I think at this point, it’s probably not the best course for Democrats,” said House Democratic Caucus Vice Chairwoman Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., when asked about the prospects for sit-in 2.0.Democrats didn’t hold the Senate in session through the night Monday, imploring Republicans to launch a debate about firearms legislation. Murphy spoke, but for just 18 minutes.“I think there is an unintentional endorsement that is sent to shooters when laughter after slaughter after slaughter and Congress does nothing,” Murphy said. “It looks like it is complicit.”With the explosion of mass shootings in recent years, Democrats frequently scold Republicans for what they see as vacuous moments of silence on the House and Senate floors and bromides of “thoughts and prayers.”Democrats may chastise their Republican colleagues for these gestures, however well intentioned. But without compelling change on the issue, the Democrats’ tactics could be just as vacant.Now to be fair, Democrats don’t control the House or Senate and can’t set the agenda.“We are stuck,” lamented Sanchez of her party’s plight.Yet Democrats founder on two points: prevailing on Republicans to bring firearms legislation to the floor, and perhaps more importantly, electing gun-reform lawmakers who would actually flip control of the House and Senate.“It baffles me as to why we can’t make that happen,” said Sanchez when addressing a way to put gun control bills on the floor. She and fellow Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty -- who represents the Connecticut district where the Sandy Hook massacre occurred -- noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., rejected an entreaty for a special, bipartisan committee on gun violence.So, if the gun issue is so resonant, why can’t Democrats make this an issue central to their campaigns?“Our agenda for the 2018 midterm is a “Better Deal” agenda, talking about better jobs, better wages and a better future for the American families,” Sanchez said.Democrats really haven’t had a successful House or Senate candidate who ran predominantly on a gun-control platform since former Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., prevailed in a 1996 House contest. A gunman opened fire on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train in 1993, killing McCarthy’s husband and seriously injuring her son.House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., says Democrats not being able to gain electoral traction on the gun issue it “confounds.”When asked whether Democrats should instead recruit candidates to favor firearm restrictions, Hoyer replied, “maybe that’s what needs to happen.”Giffords wasn’t supposed to visit Capitol Hill on Monday afternoon. She was scheduled to campaign for Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ralph Northam. But she and husband instead dropped by the Capitol to plead for firearms legislation.“The nation is counting on you,” exclaimed Giffords, pointing at the Capitol dome.Less than an hour later, House Chaplain Fr. Patrick Conroy delivered his daily invocation as the House gaveled to session. Conroy anticipated the days ahead in his prayer.“The debates will once again ensue,” said Conroy of the gun issue. “Speed us to the day where the wisdom of Solomon might inspire our congressional members beyond the limitations of sound bytes and platitudes before more American citizens are deprived of their lives.”Congress is a reactive body. But when it comes to mass shootings, a deep permafrost seals Democrats and Republicans. The venue and the horror don’t matter. An elementary school. A university. A nightclub. A baseball practice.“I do not think that that the United States Congress can legislate away evil. I don’t think the United States Congress can legislate sanity,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.And lawmakers won’t act until they think they can do something.Capitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team. Their articles take you inside the halls of Congress, and cover the spectrum of policy issues being introduced, debated and voted on there.",0
87,"New poll shows strong support for gun control measures; Garrett Tenney reports from Washington.Students are energized. People who want tighter gun restrictions are energized. Staunch defenders of the Second Amendment are energized. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez are on televisions everywhere.“My classmates and I will be turning 16 soon. We will soon be voting,” said Parkland student Monisa Olsen at the March for our Lives in Washington late last month. “Those who want to stay in, you will need to hear our voices. Listen to us instead of taking money from the NRA. Thoughts and prayers don’t count. We need action.”“If you can’t change their minds, change their seats,” said Rep. Donald McEachin, D-Va., at the gun march. “We want to make sure historic moment doesn’t pass us by.”But it remains to be seen whether firearms will be an issue in this fall’s midterm elections and help Democrats win seats.Consider the types of seats Democrats must capture to take the House. Look at the success in the recent special election in southwestern Pennsylvania. Rep.-elect Conor Lamb, D-Pa., won touting a moderate message. Democrats note that voters backed Lamb in part due to his stance on health care and ways to improve Obamacare.Guns? Nowhere to be found.Lamb won in a Republican, rural district in Pennsylvania talking about anything but guns. A discussion on gun control isn’t going to work in that district in order for a Democrat to win. Democrats can’t propound stricter gun measures in rural, Midwestern, southern districts held by Republicans if they hope to flip the House.Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-Conn., announced this week she won’t seek re-election after conceding she was delayed in disciplining her former chief of staff Tony Baker after he threatened to kill a former aide. Esty represents Newtown, Connecticut, home of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. After Esty bowed out, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) immediately declared it was “ready to win this competitive seat this fall.”Esty won her first contest for the House in November 2012 - before Sandy Hook – with just 51 percent of the vote. Her winning percentages improved in 2014 and 2016. But due to Newtown, Connecticut’s 5th District is a place where gun policy will resonate. Republicans may hope to capture the seat due to how poorly Esty handled her personnel issues. Several Republicans are already in the mix. But any successful GOPer can’t embrace the typical GOP orthodoxy on firearms and emerge victorious in a district which witnessed perhaps the most horrifying of gun tragediesStill, there are places where the gun message could work for some Democrats. Pennsylvania’s redrawn congressional map puts into play a number of suburban districts which are home to soccer moms and parents worried about school safety. Pennsylvania Republican Reps. Charlie Dent, Ryan Costello and Patrick Meehan are all retiring. But Democrats have a good shot at winning those districts, guns or not.The firearms message will certainly echo in Florida after Parkland and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016. Democrats stand a good chance to claim the seat held by retiring Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Fla. But guns could be an issue in the districts now held by Republican GOP Reps. Brian Mast and Carlos Curbelo. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, Mast presented a plan to the House Republican Conference to temporarily suspend the sale of some assault weapons. After the meeting, Mast said his proposal was met “not with thunderous applause.”However, guns could be a central issue in the Florida Senate race.Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott isn’t formally challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson yet. But Scott’s expected to enter the contest April 9. Nelson immediately called for bolstered background checks and wanted to revive the now-expired federal assault weapons ban. After Parkland, Scott ignored objections of the NRA and pushed the state legislature to lift the minimum age to purchase rifles from 18 to 21. But David Hogg and other students rebuked Scott.“You’re kind of like Voldemort at this point,” Hogg said of Scott to The Outline. “You should just retire because you aren’t going to get elected to the Senate.”Guns may not be a central policy issue in other Senate races, either.Political observers view Sen. Dean Heller, Nev., as the most-vulnerable Republican facing re-election this cycle. The massacre at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas reverberates with Nevada voters. But Heller already faced a tough contest against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen before the shooting. An anti-gun message may have more impact now with voters in Las Vegas, but not in the vast, rural parts of the Silver State.After all, this is the west.Democrats face the most-daunting map for a single party in Senate contests since 1938. Democrats are defending an astounding ten seats in states carried by President Trump. A total of 24 Democratically-held seats are up this cycle compared to a scant nine for Republicans. It will be challenging for Democrats to make any headway on gun policy in many of the states they must defend. Consider how voters would look askance at Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., if any of them supported overarching gun proposals backed by left-wing of the Democratic Party? Democrats may be lucky just to hold most of these seats. And then there are Senate Democrats running in other states where pocketbook issues, trade and health care rise to the fore. Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Tina Smith, D-Minn., can’t campaign on guns.Can Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, run successfully on firearms against GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Lone Star State? Democrats believe they have a pick-up opportunity in Arizona with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema running to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. But again, it’s the west and Sinema is a moderate. The seats Republicans are defending? Two in Mississippi. Mitt Romney is a virtual lock to succeed retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Any firearm message pushed by Democrats will go nowhere in Wyoming as Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., stands for re-election.You get the idea.The left may be revved up about guns now and students claim politicians should be on watch if they don’t align with stricter gun regulations. But it’s hard to know how the push for gun control comes to fruition in this year’s midterm elections.The students warn they’ll soon be of voting age. In his interview with The Outline, David Hogg upbraided adults, who he says don’t know how to use a democracy.We’ll know by 2020, 2022 or 2024 if the students energized this year do.",0
88,"Reaction on 'The Five' to the growing gun control debate after the massacre in Las Vegas.This is a rush transcript from ""The Five,"" October 6, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Marie Harf, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City. And this is ""The Five."" We'll go live to Las Vegas in a moment for the latest in the shooting investigation, but first the NRA stepping forward to address the minutiae effort to restrict gun use in America. Two top exec talking to Fox News, CEO Wayne LaPierre pointed to history to prove that laws only work for the law-abiding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: If legislation worked, Boston massacre wouldn't have happened. San Bernardino, where California has every gun law you can imagine on the books, that wouldn't have happened. Bad guys go about their business. They could care less what laws are on the books. And the good people want to protect themselves, they want to defend themselves. That's why we're fighting for reciprocity.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: And executive director Chris Cox points out hypocrisy on the left and guns, and said that Hollywood should bear some of the blame for mass shootings in America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The NRA spends millions of dollars every year teaching safe and responsible gun ownership, and Hollywood makes billions promoting and glorifying gun violence. And the same (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) and we're to blame for this. So there needs to be an honest conversation about solutions that work.(END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: What about that argument, Greg, the Hollywood bears some blame? GREG GUTFELD, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Look, they make a lot of money off guns. I mean, if you took out every gun from every movie you'll have a lot of people walking around like this. But I don't know if there's a correlation between violent movies and violence. What I do know, if you look, there's a lot of literature on video games. And the reason why young mask shooters have such a high kill ratio, even though they are in the military at all is because the best training program you can buy is a first-person shooter video game. So you have these kids that do head shots and -- that's an interesting correlation that links a billion dollar industry with something pretty ugly that nobody wants to talk about. I think that both sides can be right on this. I think the NRA is correct. I mean, every gun -- wherever there's a gun ban, murder rates go up. So we know that a lot of these laws don't work. And the only people who obey these laws are people who obey laws. So that's no effect on the criminal.PERINO: So true.GUTFELD: However, you can -- the other side, you can say -- at least miss somewhere when you see -- I know every -- no one knows what a bump stock was until this week. You know, it's a no lose situation. If it's a device that you add to something else to make something else into an illegal product, which is turning a semi into an auto, or whatever. Whatever the process is, I'm not an expert. It doesn't hurt to say, OK, let's stop this. If you knew there was an additive that you put to a food that made the food toxic and you knew that, you would take it off the market. So you can both be right on this. And I do understand people can make these. And by the way, you can shoot a gun without these stocks. There's a technique for doing it, so this isn't going to prevent these things, but it might reduce it or make it harder. I don't see why you can't be on both -- both can be on the same side on this. PERINO: I'm going to go ahead and call you Jason, which is hard for me because Congressman is your official title. But when you were in Congress, you had to deal with a lot of guns, gun law restriction attempts by the left, and they always seem to get pushed off because the American people have said, no, actually, this is where we are in this, is that we want the right to protect ourselves. JASON CHAFFETZ, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Well, there's almost as many guns as there are people in the United States. I happen to own five of them. I'm a member of the NBA. And nobody is going to come and take my guns away. And the good people who are law-abiding citizens have a constitutional right to have one. That's the obvious. But there are things that we can do regarding mental health and populating the database, the national database with those that don't have the mental capacity to distinguish right from wrong. We need an ATF director. We've only had one Senate-confirmed ATF director since 2006. So there are a lot of things that we can do -- wouldn't necessarily solve, you know, Las Vegas, but there is common ground. And instead of polarizing this and say, we have to get everything and other people say we're not going to do anything. Take the things we do agree on and actually make those -- but Congress is involved. And, you know, as Will Rogers said, the opposite of progress is Congress. (LAUGHTER)PERINO: Kimberly.CHAFFETZ: It's probably not going to happen.PERINO: The shooter in Vegas was not even a member of the NRA. And that was their frustration yesterday that law-abiding citizens who -- and member of the NRA that know how to properly use weapons are not necessarily the ones who are doing these crimes, these types of mass shootings. And so, they're frustrated that legislation always comes on the heels of something like this mass shooting, which, as I agree, we should do what we can, but if it's not actually prevent these type of mass shootings, then why should we infringe other people's rights? KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Well, right. And of course, people would like to, you know, paint a fresh stroke across and say, it's the NRA, it's their fault, and people who are gun owners in America, you know, you bear the burden here. But the NRA came out with very responsible and said, listen, let's put this to the ATF, like the Congressman said. They're the ones that should be making the determinations as to whether or not it is legally comply with the current laws and are within those restrictions. Otherwise, what you have is one failed attempt after the next to politicize the issue, take it to Congress, put legislation, and say, OK, we've done something. We feel good about it. And try to ban, you know, bump stocks. But then, guess what? There's going another form of innovation and then you're going to take it to legislation again, then outlawed that. So you have to have some streamlined to the process which is the ATF. But then politics comes into play again because you haven't been able to get people properly confirmed in that area. So you just really just shows and highlights the inefficiently of dealing with legislation, dealing with Congress. But at the same time, you can't just do something and react in a way because there's a powerful emotion and a devastating loss of life and you say we're going to legislate, and little by little chip away at the Second Amendment right. I mean, this was legal. He had twelve, it's outrageous. Let's look at this individual like they're doing -- doing a deep dive on his entire life and background and seeing everything about him, what he did, what he purchased, who he associated with, because there is an explanation here for why this happened. PERINO: Marie, I want you to listen to Geraldo Rivera who was talking about bump stock last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Manufacturers who create devices like bump stocks, or silencers, or other devices that have no reasonable utilization -- I mean, the tiny, tiny percentage for sportsman. But generally speaking, have no utilization other than to be more efficient killing machines. I believe that those manufacturers of the bump stocks should be held liable when they are used, those bump stocks, and other similar devices to inflict damage on others.(END VIDEO CLIP)  PERINO: What do you think about that, Marie? MARIE HARF, ""THE FIVE"" CO-HOST: Well, legally, I don't know. Obviously, Kimberly would be the expert here on the legal front. I do want gun manufacturers and companies to take a more corporate responsible approach to this. And it's not just -- I don't think it can be the bigger the gun, the bigger the magazine, the more that we are able to sell, the better. I want them to play a role in this conversation of the Congressman is talking about. And yes, there will always be bad people. But let's make it harder for bad people to do bad things. You know, looking at things like people on the no-fly list. You know, Congress had talked about that issue at one point, should be able to buy guns? People who have been convicted of domestic abuse? Should they be able to buy guns? I don't know the answers here, but I want to make it harder for bad people to do bad things. I think the gun company should play a role in that. PERINO: But the frustrating thing is, all those things are just that wouldn't apply to. GUTFELD: No. HARF: Of course they wouldn't. But they might apply to one of the others. GUTFELD: I think that, you know, a lot of these things -- we know that that was unstoppable. And we know that if somebody who has a high I.Q. who has the means is going to do it, and we have 7.5 billion people on this planet. It's going to happen again and it might be a terrorist or might be a loner. We may never know this motive. All we have to figure out is how do we prevent something like this. And it's not going to be, essentially, just laws. I'm fine. Go after the bump stocks. The fact is you don't need one of those to fire a gun as an automatic. There are ways you can get around that. It's very easy. So this is again is a symbolic gesture. And a lot of these laws are symbolic gestures. And the problem with symbolic gestures is they replace action. So you think, oh, we've got this thing done and everything is good. Instead of actually thinking about real prevention, which is high-tech prevention, using drones so that when you have an outdoor event, you have swarming drones that protect the people out there, who can look around, because that's where the next threat is. It's above. If you've got the security around an area, it's up there that where it's coming. PERINO: Kimberly, I want to read you something from Peggy Noonan today in the Wall Street Journal said, maybe we're looking at this the wrong way. GUILFOYLE: And I'll tell you about the law as well. PERINO: OK, good, that would be helpful. Here's Peggy Noonan's quote, I think a lot of Americans have guns because they're fearful and for damn good reason. They fear a coming chaos. And know that when it's happen it would be coming to a nation that no longer coheres. They think it's all collapsing, our society, our culture, the baseline confidence of our leadership class. And, unlike their cultural superiors, they understand the implications. To her point was we keep going around and around on this issue that doesn't actually ever solve anything when things -- we should probably take a step back and look at is why people do feel fearful. GUILFOYLE: Sure. I mean, there's a lot that's happening, especially what we've seen with terror attacks not only here domestically but, you know, abroad. And just the frequency of them. So people feel like they want to be able to protect their families. Guess what, for whatever reason they so choose that they would like to buy a weapon, it's within their legal rights as long as they comply the law, they've done the background checks, and they've been able to be, you know, responsible in terms of their guns ownerships, and safety training, and protecting their family. That's the bottom line. I think she's tapping into a sort of a feeling, you know, that's out there to be distinguished. Greg, we started talking about this the other day when President Obama talked about people clinging to guns and religions, he was using that as a put down to people that weren't voting for him, or for conservatives, or people that support the second amendment are actually in support of the Constitution. Next thing I wanted to touch on was there is a 2005 law called the protectable of lawful commerce and arms act, and it was brought forward in the '90s and early 2000 because the amount of litigation towards gun manufacturers to protect them from frivolous lawsuits and not hold them accountable. If they had legally complied and put forward an item like a bump stock that was legal at the time, they can't be held responsible for loss of life in terms of the liability. However, they will be held responsible and the law will not protect a defect in a manufacturing, and that's how you distinguish it.PERINO: All right. GUTFELD: Could I just add -- whenever this happens, you get this blanket damning of people who own firearms. That's why Jason was responding on the way he does. But there's research out there that shows that arm citizens responding to mass killings or mass attack rampage, rampage killings, result in one eighth of the casualties. And the reason is obvious. It takes time for the police to get there. It takes them 70 minutes, in some cases, or longer or shorter. But -- the only variable that reduces death is the time it takes to get a second gun there. So, you know, it's the non-gun owning families living in areas where people own guns that should be grateful because there might be somebody in your neighborhood that owns a gun. CHAFFETZ: It just happened in the south. Remember, there's a church.GUTFELD: Exactly.CHAFFETZ: And the guy ran out, went to his car, came back, and was able to suppress the person. PERINO: He was the usher of the church. GUTFELD: Yes. So if that gun wasn't present, God knows what would have happened. PERINO: Not only that but John Rich, remember, on Monday when we did the show, he talked about being at his bar in Las Vegas and the off-duty Minnesota police officer said, if you're carrying, are you comfortable me holding your weapon to protect everybody inside this bar. Like, absolutely, let's do it. GUILFOYLE: Stood there the whole time at the front door like for the next hour. PERINO: I'm sure everybody was grateful for it. All right. Ahead, the art of the tease, President Trump leaves us with a big cliffhanger after his meeting with military leaders. Can we sort it out? Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: President Trump likes to keep our adversary on edge with tough talk to signal his administration will act on threats pose to the United States. It appears he was trying to send another strong signal yesterday with this remark following a meeting with military leaders.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: You guys know what this represents? Maybe it's the calm before the storm. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: What storm would that be? TRUMP: The calm before the storm. UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: What storm? TRUMP: We have the world's great military people in this room. I'll tell you that. And we'll have a great evening. Thank you all for coming. UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: What storm, Mr. President? TRUMP: You'll find out.(END VIDEO CLIP)  GUILFOYLE: Reporters try to get clarification from him earlier, but to no avail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, what do you mean by calm before the storm?TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much.(INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: You'll find out.(INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: Thank you. You'll see.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: The press secretary didn't divulge anything, either.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: We're never going to say in advance what the president is going to do. And as he said last night in addition to those comments you'll have to wait and see. I think you can take the president protecting the American people always extremely serious. He's been very clear that that's his number one priority. And if he feels that action is necessary, he'll take it.(END VIDEO CLIP)  GUILFOYLE: Well, was he referring to North Korea, or perhaps Iran? Well, there are reports that the president could soon decertify the Obama administration's nuclear deal with the Mullahs. OK, Congressman, so happy that you're with us today. CHAFFETZ: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: We can ask you a million questions. So what do you make of the situation? Is he just sort of posturing and putting a little thing out there. Is he kidding?CHAFFETZ: I mean, he's obviously enjoying that. I mean, look at that smile. He got a wink out of it. You know, he did a whole lot of stuff. But. GUILFOYLE: Politics is unpredictability. CHAFFETZ: I do think this is actually a good position to be, rather than the big group-hug that Barack Obama tried to put out there to the world. I do think he want people to know that you're the world superpower and you can use that force if you need to. And to the military leaders of our own arm services, you have got to be able to fight on two fronts. We haven't necessarily have the capability to that. You hear what's happening with our ships. You hear about, you know -- hey, we better get our act in order because we've got to be able to deal with something in the Middle East, and be able to take care of North Korea in Asia. And when you have the majority of your naval forces in the Pacific -- hey, folks, you better get your ships in order because there may be something that blows up and we've got to deal with it. GUILFOYLE: Such an important point, especially when you look to defense cuts or defense spending to be able to that. We haven't been put to the test in that regard in terms of having to battle in to completely -- different geopolitical arenas. Marie, what do you make of the comment? HARF: I think this was a little bit of the entertainment aspect. I mean, President Trump is very good at this, right? He's very good at keeping people guessing what he's going to do. I think that helps with things like ratings, but also to keep people interested. I also think that unpredicted ability can be a tactic, right? If other countries think that Donald Trump is so serious that he will go after North Korea if they cross a red line, I think that can be helpful. Now, I will caveat that by saying I want there to be a strategy underlying that unpredictability, and that's what people like Generals Master and McMaster -- Mattis and McMaster, I put the two together, people like Rex Tillerson, that's what they're trying to do. So I hope all of that work is being done behind the scenes to underlie what I think is a little bit of, hey, you guys don't know what I'm going to do next. You better stay on your toes. GUILFOYLE: So Dana, a little bit of the politics of unpredictability, but also what about a plan? PERINO: Well, I think they have a plan. I'm not worried. I'm actually not worried about that. And I think -- I don't know. Maybe there's going to be something? I guess we'll all be paying attention. But I do think there's something about this president being able to drop a little catnip out there and the reporters all run to it. I remember having a group of students with me and they were getting like their pictures taken with President Bush and he was talking to them, and the media was all behind them. And as he talked to them, he said now watch this. If my move my hand like this, all the cameras are going to go off. If the president has the ability to manipulate with gestures, with words with a wink. I mean, CNN did a whole thing today about what did that wink mean. What kind of wink does it? So, maybe he's planning something I don't know. But I took it to be just a little bit playful. CHAFFETZ: What are you doing watching CNN? PERINO: I did and I heard about it on the twitter.CHAFFETZ: OK, good.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: She heard a rumor that happened on CNN. OK, so Greg, what did you make of the wink? You sort of did one right there.GUTFELD: Calm before the storm? He could be talking about a tweet storm. It is Friday. Generally, Saturday mornings is when he gets up and he tweets like crazy, or he could have had some bad shrimp. I usually call that the calm before the storm. You're at a thing. You have the hors d'oeuvres, and all of a sudden things aren't working too well. Calm before the storm. He could have been referring to a made-for-TV movie on Lifetime starring Ted Danson and Meg Ryan, calm before the storm, two divorcees meet on a cruise ship. Calm before the storm. And they end up being stuck in Bermuda. The fact is. GUILFOYLE: Please work in love, actually.GUTFELD: Love, actually.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Hate, actually. Love, actually. This is pure Trump. And that he's trolling the global adversaries because he knows it costs very little. It cost him nothing to do that, but it has a wide impact. So it's just something that he can just do and just watch everything move around. And then he moves on and then he laughs, and that's what happens. And it is. It's true. It's helpful to be ambiguous, which it was. I mean, ambiguity means it could be anything. PERINO: Or nothing. GUTFELD: Or nothing. And that's kind of what you want sometimes.PERINO: Like covfefe.GUTFELD: It works everywhere. GUILFOYLE: I thought about that today. Like, there's covfefe again. But, you know, it seems to be, sort of, irritating Kim Jong-un. He's hiring all these experts to interpret Trump, to speak Trump, and what does it means. So somewhere in North Korea, they're evaluating and analyzing the wink. Ahead, California deals a blow to President Trump's deportation agenda, granting safe haven to illegal immigrants. Details on that controversy, next. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HARF: California has just delivered a blow to President Trump's immigration agenda. Governor Jerry Brown signing a bill yesterday to make it a sanctuary state to protect illegal immigrants from the feds and obstruct the president's deportation agenda. The decision follows Attorney General Jeff Sessions' move to slash federal grant funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. OK, Congressman, I feel like you have a lot to say on this topic. I'm coming to you first. CHAFFETZ: I could rant for an hour about how fundamentally wrong this is from top to bottom. They literally, the Democrats, who own the state house on the governors' office, they literally passed a law that says we will not cooperate with law enforcement. Are you kidding me? For all the righteous indignation that Democrats put out there -- you know, we need to get along. We need to work together. We need to find bipartisan solutions. They're not going to work for law enforcement? And I'm sorry, but the Obama administration is the one that released 86,000 people that were here illegally, got caught committing a crime, then instead of deporting them, release them back out into the public, 86,000. And they went on to commit thousands of crimes. And so, when our law enforcement is trying to work, just cooperate with local law enforcement, I can't believe that we had a state that passes a law saying we will not cooperate with the federal government. HARF: And the governor said that he was trying to strike a balance between public safety, and also these people that are living in fear.CHAFFETZ: Yeah. I'll tell you what. How about when there's a forest fire and they want federal resources the fed say, nah.(CROSSTALK)CHAFFETZ: How about when there's a bank robbery? Maria: That's a great point. That's a great point. I'm going to come to Kimberly with that. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off federal funding over these kinds of legislative efforts at the state level. Can they legally do that and should they? GUILFOYLE: Yeah, they should. I think this is such nonsense. I'm so glad I left California. I don't know what happened after Greg and I left. But total disaster. GUTFELD: Oh, that drive across country was amazing. GUILFOYLE: We'll do it again.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: This is basically an anti-Trump piece of legislation. The same people that were against the president when he got in. So they feel very, you know, like they're going to pave the way, lead the way, they said we're going to show the rest of the country that this is what you can do to fight back, et cetera. Really? Until there's senseless loss of lives because you're creating a gap into communication between the feds and between local law enforcement, so that people who are on the ground with the most information about who the people are in their states and who are committing the crimes now cannot talk to the feds to let them know and communicate. So then we're going to see more crimes like the loss of life of Kate Steinle. So how is the governor going to feel about that? When crimes like that that can be prevented -- OK, because of the revolving door, because everyone takes his hands off approach because they care more about politics and public safety and lives, this is what the result is going to be. So, you know, this is an example of California winning. It's horrific. HARF: And this is one of the reasons the governor also gave was that he didn't want these immigrants to be afraid to report crimes to the police, which you often hear from people on these sanctuary city kinds of deals. But Dana, I'm coming to you because there's an estimated 10 million immigrants in California, that's more than the entire state of Michigan, more people, 25 percent are thought to be undocumented. And the governor was very clear that these people are scare, or he thinks they're in fear, and they were trying to address that. How do you strike that right balance? PERINO: Well, if you think that law enforcement has come forward, then they're split. There are some across the country who say this -- what California did is absolutely unnecessary, and others who say actually it is a problem, because we need them to talk with us. So, you know, law enforcement can sort that out. I would -- I do want to talk about one thing. In the opening, you said that California has put a wrench in President Trump's immigration agenda. I actually think that just helped it tremendously. HARF: Interesting. PERINO: Because now, we're going to talk about it a lot more and it might push this to the courts sooner, and I think that President Trump will win there. GUILFOYLE: They put fuel on the fire. HARF: Yes, that's right. Greg.GUTFELD: This is politics run by animosity. It's pure symbolism.PERINO: Breaking news. GUTFELD: I know. I know the word ""virtue signaling"" is getting old. But this is one giant -- this is one giant virtue signal by a state. How -- here's the question. If Democrat -- Democratic representatives are influenced by illegal aliens politically demonstrating, isn't that illegal foreign influence on politics? That's just a question for later.PERINO: Maybe Bob Mueller should look into it.GUTFELD: Exactly. I think it's time to invade California and arrest Jerry Brown. Why -- how can he still be governor? He was governor when I was a kid, and he's governor now! GUILFOYLE: Moonbeam.GUTFELD: I liked him when he was dating Linda Ronstadt. GUILFOYLE: Those were the days.HARF: The governor dealing with millions and millions of people. It's a really tough issue, obviously. GUTFELD: That's why they're elected. HARF: Exactly. So ahead...GUTFELD: Not to break laws. HARF: ... was there someone else in the room? Did the Las Vegas gunman have help? Possible new breakthroughs in the investigation coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CHAFFETZ: Chilling new video has emerged showing the panic and chaos in Las Vegas Sunday night after a madman opened fire. And there are new developments in the investigation into whether the killer had help. For the very latest, let's go to Dan Springer in Las Vegas. Dan, what's the latest? DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jason. The headline from today's new conference, which happened just a short time ago, unfortunately, is a small one. That after nearly five full days of investigation going through many, many leads, police still don't have a motive. And the frustration is clearly showing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHERIFF JOSEPH LOMBARDO, CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA: To date, we have run down more than 1,000 leads in this investigation. While some of it has helped create a better profile into the madness of the suspect, we do not, still, have a clear motive or reason why. (END VIDEO CLIP)SPRINGER: The undersheriff did at least refute an NBC report today which said there was evidence someone entered Stephen Paddock's room at the same time his car was out of the hotel parking garage, indicating possibly a second person. Police said that did not occur. They did not address another aspect of that same report, that investigators found a phone charger which did not -- which did not match any of the phones they recovered from Paddock. Meantime, police confirmed reports of explosives found in Paddock's car, along with 1,600 rounds of animation. The plan may have been to detonate a car bomb. The explosives were not in the form of pipe bombs or other IEDs. And there are reports today that Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has told investigators that recently Paddock has occasionally woken in the middle of the night agitated, moaning, and he also apparently has gained a lot of weight recently and also became obsessed with Danley's ex-husband. None of which points to the carnage that he unleashed Sunday night -- Jason.CHAFFETZ: Thanks, Dan. Kimberly, I -- I watched that press conference, and it was a little disconcerting to me that here you have the special agent in charge of the FBI field office, and he goes to the microphone. And you want to hear something. And he talks about how they're going to put up a billboard, hoping that people call in with more information. Where does this go? GUILFOYLE: Well, the problem is, you know, a lot of times some of your best resources are the people out there with eyes and ears, with iPhones, that might have seen or heard something. So you always want to reach out to them for sure. And I think it's because they're feeling a little bit frustrated, because this wasn't somebody that left any kind of real digital footprint to give some clues as to who he was associating with. And that's why they're doing this deep dive, going back so many years. Also especially concentrating on the last five years in terms of any contacts, any associates, any affiliations. That's why his girlfriend was so important and integral to the investigation. Because right away, they were able to get some of his items, you know, personal items and telephones, et cetera, to see what's on there. But this is obviously a person of very high intelligence. There's something that went wrong. There was some kind of catalyst or some kind of intervening factor, incident, association, contact that he had and also perhaps a different change in his mental state. But what we see is that he wasn't criminally insane to the point that he wasn't able to premeditate and plan and carefully think out and try some different venues in terms of booking rooms, making charges in advance to be able to do this, versus some of the cash items we talked about on Dana's show, purchasing homes for large, hundreds of thousands of dollars, three hundred and, you know, fifty thousand dollars. PERINO: That's right.GUILFOYLE: So I think they have more questions right now than they have answers. But when you hear them come out and do a conference like that, it's not making sense to them either. And even the elaborate set-up in the room with the two, you know, the sniper nest, the two shooting platforms, and just a lot of that went into it, I feel that he definitely had to have someone that was assisting him along the way. CHAFFETZ: Now, part of what's going to change here is going to be the atmosphere in how you deal with these large venues and large crowds. And it's interesting to me what happened with the Department of Defense. Because the Pentagon actually went out and studied, how do you fight improvised exposed devices? How do you find weapons? And you know what? They spent $19 billion, and they came to the conclusion the single best way to find these weapons and guns? PERINO: Dogs. CHAFFETZ: Is a dog.PERINO: Yes.CHAFFETZ: How is this going to change what happens in big venues?PERINO: Well, that's always -- that is really important in the training. But I think what Greg's been talking about all week, which is trying to figure out, then, how -- if civilians are going to become the targets on the ground, and we have capable -- civilians who might do bad things, have the capability to get up above with a drone or a higher up, that at some point do you have some sort of security measures that are also up in the sky? I don't know. CHAFFETZ: And we have heard that terrorists are training to use swarms of drones to come at us. And we have to figure out how to -- how to defend against that. But we are supposed to be running around scared? I mean, do we go to big venues? What do you see happening here? HARF: You make a good point. Drones can be used for good or for evil. Right? And you're absolutely right that terrorists like ISIS or others, al Qaeda in Yemen, have posted videos online using these things and, I think, to scare people. No, we can't live our lives scared. We can't. That's not who we are as Americans. That's not what we can do. But we also have to recognize that we have a ton of soft targets in America, right? Every, you know, huge sporting event, concert. And most people don't want to stand in line in a magnetometer for three hours before the concert, right? PERINO: But even if you do, it doesn't matter. HARF: And even if you do, it doesn't -- exactly. So I think that we have to figure out a way to prevent some of these things. With terrorism, for example, every time there's a new threat, we try to take steps to prevent that from happening. So I don't know what -- again, I don't know what the answer is. I feel like the thing with today is we don't have all the answers yet, but we have to figure out how to handle some of this. CHAFFETZ: What did you -- Greg, what did you get out of that press conference today? GUTFELD: Not much. I think what -- we have to ask ourselves, what if all we get from this is stuff about him but never a motive, which would be the final trick in this crazy fantasy? I mean, he could be a high I.Q. psychopath, and this could've been a long-standing fantasy of his that he believes he could've pulled this off. Could've been a brain tumor like Charles Woodman in the Texas tower. But he deliberately, it seems to me, left -- he disappeared.And I think that this might be just an exercise in ""What if I could do this"" and a purely evil thing that -- and if somebody puts their mind to it and that mind has a high I.Q., they could do it. Having said that, hardening soft targets should be an industry. It should be an industry as big as the entertainment industry, media, academia. It should be a major. You should be overpaid for it. And it should be -- it should be all the best minds. Silicon Valley, they should be on top of this. GUILFOYLE: They worried about that in Vegas, and that's why Steve Wynn did that. He hardened the soft target with their hotel and had security experts, former Navy SEALs, come in and do just that. CHAFFETZ: Dogs. They spent $19 billion in studying this, and dogs was the solution. ""Facebook Friday"" is up next. Don't go anywhere. Aim, but... You know how they send you money to cover repairs and... (COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: You don't like that?PERINO: It's scary.GUTFELD: All right. It's been a tough week, and it's been a long week. So we're going to lighten things up a bit with some of your questions for ""Facebook Friday."" All right. The first one is a good question from Sandra M.: ""Who is your favorite person to follow on social media and why?"" I'm going to go to Marie first. HARF: Well, I'm not on Twitter anymore. But my favorite person is the fake Marie Harf, which is @MarieBarf. GUTFELD: Marie Barf.HARF: On Twitter. Which scarred me as a child. I have -- I think it was Greg. GUTFELD: No, no. It actually is Lou Dobbs. But that's so nice! Does it make you laugh when you see it? HARF: Sometimes. GUTFELD: Yes, but...PERINO: It's pretty mean. It's pretty mean.GUTFELD: But you know what? We're grown-ups. We can handle that, Kimberly. GUILFOYLE: Yes, sure. I don't think that's very nice, though.GUTFELD: What's yours? Well, who's nice on Twitter? No one is nice.HARF: That's why I'm not on it anymore! GUILFOYLE: OK, so for real life...GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: I like Sean Hannity's. Because when he fights with, like, Joe Scarborough, I find it unbelievable entertaining. GUTFELD: They're out of control. GUILFOYLE: Yes. I, like, stayed up one night with my friend, Ann, and we were just, like, reading them back and forth to each other. GUTFELD: That is. It's like watching a crazy ping-pong battle between Godzilla and King Kong. PERINO: It's a modern barfight.GUTFELD: Yes. It is. Without the broken bottles. PERINO: Well, maybe.GUTFELD: All right, Jason. Who do you follow? You can say me, it's OK. CHAFFETZ: I hadn't thought of that. I should start to follow you.GUTFELD: And I mean on Twitter.CHAFFETZ: I actually -- I actually really like David Beckham. I'm a huge English Premier League fan. GUTFELD: Interesting.CHAFFETZ: I love soccer. Grew up playing soccer.GUILFOYLE: Wow. GUTFELD: Wow.CHAFFETZ: David Beckham makes it really fun. GUILFOYLE: I follow him, too.CHAFFETZ: He's a great guy, does his stuff with his little kids and it's -- I don't know. It's clean. It's fun. GUTFELD: He plays that -- he plays that interesting sport with a ball. CHAFFETZ: With the ball. The real sport. The beautiful sport. GUTFELD: ""You cannot use your hands."" CHAFFETZ: The beautiful sport, yes.GUTFELD: It makes it extra difficult, Dana. You can't use your hands. What -- who do you follow that you enjoy? PERINO: I love Iowa Hawk. GUTFELD: Oh, Iowa Hawk. He's great.PERINO: Caged bird (ph).GUTFELD: Yes, he's very good. Very good, very good.PERINO: Hilarious. And he's been great for years. GUTFELD: Yes. Well, do you know who I'm going to pick. I'm going to go off Twitter. I'm going to say Tom from MySpace. GUILFOYLE: You're hilarious. Barsell Sports (ph) is pretty funny, too.GUTFELD: Actually, you know, I -- every morning, because I quote him a lot, is Scott Adams. He does this thing every morning, which is a periscope. So he gets up in the morning, and he goes, ""Hello, everybody, grab your coffee."" And he grabs his coffee, and he drinks his coffee. And for, like, 30 minutes he talks about the news of the day. And he's uncannily able to predict certain things, and it's very relaxing. GUILFOYLE: Why don't you do something like that? GUTFELD: I'd rather...PERINO: Do you want to see him in the morning, drinking his coffee?GUILFOYLE: In the shorty robe? I'm scarred already for life. GUTFELD: It's a normal sized robe. This is from Luciana R.: ""The first thing that pops into your head to describe 2017 so far."" Dana.PERINO: It feels like five years in one. GUTFELD: That's good, but that's more than one word. PERINO: One word?GUTFELD: You'll have to leave the table. Get your things and go. PERINO: ""Chaotic."" GUTFELD: Chaotic?HARF: That was mine. PERINO: Well, press secretaries think alike. GUTFELD: What about you, Jason?CHAFFETZ: Is ""Crazy-town"" one word?GUTFELD: It's a terrible band. PERINO: Hyphenated, I think.GUTFELD: What was that song called? CHAFFETZ: I want everybody at home -- this is the first time I've done this. I want everybody to know...GUTFELD: ""Butterfly.""CHAFFETZ: ... they don't give you these questions in advance. PERINO: Yes. It's a very hard test. Very hard. CHAFFETZ: They don't give you the questions in advance.GUTFELD: Is the song ""Butterfly?"" PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Wasn't ""Donnie Darko""?PERINO: I think so?GUILFOYLE: Keep it going, Greg.GUTFELD: Sorry. I got -- OK. GUILFOYLE: You're losing control again.GUTFELD: She took your word.HARF: ""Exhausting."" GUTFELD: Exhausting. Interesting. Everybody is saying kind of the similar thing, Kimberly. Break it up. GUILFOYLE: Well, since I can't say two words and the hyphen thing has been done. Instead of political revolution, I'll say, ""My guy"" (ph) because that sort of sums it up. GUTFELD: You know what I'm going to say ""deceptive."" Deceptive. Because it feels chaotic.PERINO: It's one thing, and it's the other thing.GUTFELD: It feels chaotic. Like, for example, a lot of the horrible things that have happened are out of our control, whether it's tragedies or hurricanes. When you subtract that out, it doesn't seem all that different, in my view, from any other time. I mean, it's not like there was some evil coup. It's just a lot of stuff that happens, but it's just -- life goes on. Low unemployment. People are optimistic about the economy. Anyway, I'll shut up. I'm sorry.PERINO: Look at you being the optimistic one. GUTFELD: I'm sorry. PERINO: Boy, that's a long question.GUTFELD: This is a long one. I'm going to get to -- OK, Thomas H.: ""You wake up one morning and everything is the same. Instead of Donald Trump, the president is Greg Gutfeld. What would your first reaction and would you want to return to your original universe or stay?"" That is a brilliant question! So they're saying you wake up tomorrow morning, and I am president; and you have a choice: to return to your original universe or stay in the Gutfeld presidency. Kimberly.GUILFOYLE: OK, I would stay in the Gutfeld presidency. Because I know you would cranky and tired of being, and I would most certainly be your vice president, and I would take over everything.GUTFELD: That is true.GUILFOYLE: And kill all the bad guys! GUTFELD: That is so true.Marie.HARF: I would definitely stay. GUTFELD: Really?HARF: No explanation needed.GUTFELD: I would be one heck of a president. CHAFFETZ: I am going to Gutfeld world. Because earlier, before the show, you told us the No. 1 thing you want to achieve in life is comfort. GUTFELD: Yes. That's right! Exactly. I would be the first comfort president. I just want -- I don't want, like -- I want everybody to be comfortable. Couches on every corner.GUILFOYLE: You'd do a little recliner, like a La-Z-Boy? PERINO: I think that I'm going to go with -- I'm going to -- I'll stay with you. And that your hashtag could be #gaga. GUTFELD: That's pretty good. That's very funny. And then the first lady could be Lady Gaga. You know, but the first thing I'd do if I was president? GUILFOYLE: How about your wife? GUTFELD: That's what I said. She's the first lady. Lady Gaga.Now, the first thing I would do is I would remove all those signs from amusement parks that have a height requirement. PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: Because that is a problem for many people. That is bigotry against the height challenged! PERINO: Are you going to do that when you walk under a...GUTFELD: Oh, stop it.PERINO: ... dispenser or Purell? GUTFELD: So I hit a Purell, and I got it all over me.""One More Thing"" is up next. GUILFOYLE: Drip on him.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for ""One More Thing."" I'll go first. So I just finished my first week of hosting ""The Daily Briefing"" at 2 p.m. Thanks to everybody. Kimberly was on today, and she was brilliant in talking about the investigation in Vegas. GUTFELD: Thanks for having me on. PERINO: You're going to be on soon. I'm making -- I'm going to gear up for that. I'm not going to be there Monday. I have to go to a previously planned trip to Vegas. GUTFELD: Already taking a vacation day! PERINO: On Tuesday, I'm going to be at the Bush Center in Dallas, and Laura Bush will be one of my many guests that day. So I hope you tune in for that. GUILFOYLE: But she's working. GUTFELD: OK, never mind.PERINO: I'm working. Hello?GUTFELD: You win this round.GUILFOYLE: OK, so I was off yesterday, thank you so much everyone for letting me have the day off. It was for Ronan's birthday. He turned 11, little Ro-Dog. There he is with his mama.PERINO: That's so pretty.GUILFOYLE: He's so cute, isn't he? And then a picture with his father, Eric. And that was over the summer. And we had the party at Chelsea Piers of Bowlmore Lane (ph). GUTFELD: I wasn't invited. GUILFOYLE: Yes, but you would've been -- fit in perfectly inside. We had a lovely time bowling, arcade games, red velvet cupcakes. Of course, pigs in a blanket, my favorite. That's us there, having a fabulous time. And then there's a little video here. There's the Ro-Dog killing it with the Titans. That's another touchdown.PERINO: Wow.GUILFOYLE: Baby's got wheels. The kid's frustrated.PERINO: Wow, good catch!GUILFOYLE: Yes. There you go. So he's -- it's flag football. So please don't write in and...PERINO: We don't need that. GUILFOYLE: Happy birthday, Ronan! Love you, baby. PERINO: All right, Greg. What do you have? GUTFELD: All right. Saturday, October 7, that's tomorrow, 10 p.m. we've got a great show. We've got Mark Stein, Pete Hegseth, Kat Timpf and Tyrus. It's going to be a real barn burner, as they say.Now it's time for this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: ""Greg's What's This?""(END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: All right. Let's roll this tape. This is very interesting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CAT AND DOG ON STEPS)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: You've got a cat and a dog on the steps, right? So the cat, like, is looking at the dog. The dog is just checking him out. And then he does that.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.GUTFELD: So just when you think that's all that happens. And then something happens to the dog. PERINO: I love this.GUTFELD: So what is this? I want to ask people at home to write to me and ask what is going on here? PERINO: It's called the Zoomies.GUTFELD: The Zoonies?PERINO: The Zoomies.GUTFELD: The Zoomies. Look, it's just... GUILFOYLE: Is that in real time? GUTFELD: You know, this goes on for six hours. And we're going to roll it. We're going right into ""Special Report"" on this. PERINO: He's taking all his frustration out.GUTFELD: Very crazy. They're going to have to do this again. All right. I'm going to shut up now.GUILFOYLE: I thought the dog was going to pounce on him. PERINO: No. Dogs don't do that. All right. Jason, you're next.CHAFFETZ: Jon Huntsman has become the new ambassador from the United States to Russia. And once upon a time, I was his campaign manager and his chief of staff. GUILFOYLE: Fabulous. CHAFFETZ: Here's a story about him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're brothers. They're serving this country, and they're proud to do so. Do you worry where the country is right now? That we are losing that sense of service? JON HUNTSMAN, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: I think we are still the greatest country on the face of the earth when it comes to our commitment to service, our volunteer spirit. Show me another country in the world that turns out during a time of need. It's hard to even talk about. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're going to make me cry. HUNTSMAN: It's a great place.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: So cute.CHAFFETZ: That, of course, was his daughter Abby. GUTFELD: Really? CHAFFETZ: Yes.GUTFELD: I didn't know that. I thought it was just coincidence that their last name was ""Huntsman."" Thanks, Jason. PERINO: And now you've been truly initiated into ""The Five.""CHAFFETZ: Could be an oversight that I gave. I just want to make sure the record is... GUILFOYLE: Fabulous family. Really wonderful.PERINO: Marie, take it away. HARF: Well, for Greg or any of our viewers who are looking for a new workout regime, on October 17, a book called the ""RBG Workout: How She Stays Strong, and You Can, Too"" will hit bookstores.

89,"Are more laws the solution to mass shootings? Republican strategist Jen Kerns debate Liberal commentator Wendy Osefo on 'Fox & Friends First.'In the wake of this week’s deadly Florida high school shooting, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel called out local lawmakers during a candlelight vigil for the victims, saying those who did not push for new gun laws ""will not get reelected.""""If you're an elected official, and you want to keep things the way they are, and not do things differently, if you want to keep the gun laws as they are now, you will not get re-elected in Broward County,” Israel said Thursday night to cheers, as locals grieved the 17 victims killed a day earlier.The vigil in Parkland, near the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, drew about 1,000 people and attendees at one point began chanting ""No more guns! No more guns!"", according to the Associated Press.People hoist up their candles during a vigil for the victims of the Wednesday shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Many showed up wearing red – the school color, and one sign read ""Kids don't need guns. No guns under 21.""Israel's remarks and some of the signs in the crowd mirrored the familiar debate that follows most school and mass shootings in the U.S., with one side typically championing gun control and another group advocating more gun rights --  but both sides looking to solve the same problem.Israel’s comments Thursday came after he told reporters people being treated for mental illnesses shouldn’t be allowed to purchase firearms.Jorge Zapata, Jr., center, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, holds candles with his mother Lavinia Zapata, and father Jorge Zapata, Sr., during a candlelight vigil Wednesday.

“Certainly more money should go to mental health. I’ve said this time and time again. If you tear a knee up, you go to an orthopedic surgeon. If we have mental health issues, we need to be treated,” Israel said earlier in the day. “But while people who are the victim of mental health illnesses in this country are being treated, in the opinion of this sheriff, they should not be able to buy, surround themself, purchase, or carry a handgun. Those two things don’t mix.”Israel also appeared on MSNBC Thursday night and urged politicians to do “what is in the best interest of our children.""“I’ve spent a lifetime in law enforcement protecting peoples’ rights, but at the end of the day the rights of our children must be first and foremost,” he said. “And lawmakers gotta change the way they do things. The same ol', same ol' just ain’t working."" ",0

SETH MYERS, NBC: Is that the best plan? Do you see -- for dealing with gun violence when there's a shooting, we just pray for a miracle? TREVOR NOAH, COMEDY CENTRAL: Sorry that we live in a world where there are people who will put a gun before your lives. STEPHEN COLBERT, CBS: Congress can be heroes by doing literally anything. Universal background checks, or come up with a better answer. And force Obama's executive order to deny mentally ill gun purchases. Or a better answer. Reinstate the assault weapons ban or come up with a better answer, anything but nothing. Doing nothing is cowardice.(END VIDEO CLIPS)I tried to come up with a similar montage about the 4,300 shooting victims in Chicago last year. No luck. And here I thought this was about guns.But last night was all about unison. People claim gun control talk is being silenced. This is silence? Look, I don't blame them at all. In the circles that they run in, such outrage is required. And they mean it. So what do they have in mind, specifically, besides do something, do anything? Colbert, at least he has suggestions. But would they have stopped this fiend? But I get to it. I'd throw the kitchen sink at terrorism -- a sentiment mocked many times by these very same people. But unlike them, I'm a little flexible. Sure, let's ban ""bump stocks."" It would make me feel better, though I'm not sure it would help because I think people will make their own. You can make your own guns now.But should that matter? According to Reason Magazine, from 1992 to 2014, the number of U.S. civilian firearms had increased by 50 percent, while the murder rate has dropped by more than half. Think about that. That's amazing. So more guns doesn't equal more deaths. But still, the media focuses on the gun, especially early on before all is known. Why is that? My theory is if you focus on a weapon allows you to spread some blame onto people that you already dislike: gun owners, Republicans, Trump voters. Sometimes it feels like a class thing. Remember that CBS lawyer saying she had no sympathy for the victims because they were gun-loving ""Rethuglicans""? She got fired, and for what? Saying what she thought her friends wanted to hear.

Griff Jenkins reports from Washington D.C.People from around the world came together Saturday for the March for Our Lives gun control rally organized by the students of the Florida high school impacted by a deadly school shooting last month.The primary march is taking place in Washington, D.C., on Pennsylvania Avenue at 12 p.m. EST. Some 500,000 people were expected to attend.Thousands of people are expected to gather across the world Saturday for the March for Our Lives rally.

In addition to Washington, D.C., some 800 sister marches were also being planned in London, Tokyo, Sydney, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Mumbai, and the city where the shooting occurred: Parkland, Florida.Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School organized the rally following the deadly school shooting on Feb. 14, 2018, that left 17 people dead. The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, 19, used a legally purchased an AR-15 assault rifle to carry out the shooting. The students hope the rally will push lawmakers to pass legislation on gun control. Some students said the ultimate goal of the grassroots movement is to inspire people to vote in November for lawmakers wiling to reform gun control.While the activists “support the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms, as set forth in the United States Constitution,” they also have a list of demands, urging members of Congress to pass laws to end the sale of high-capacity magazines, improve background checks, and more safety measures.The students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas have organized the rally to demand a change following last month's deadly school shooting.

Many celebrities such as Steven Spielberg, Clooney, and Taylor Swift donated thousands of dollars to the march.However, some people feel left out from the march or believe the rally will not do much to change what is already in place.Kyle Kashuv, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, has been a prominent advocate for preventing violence while respecting gun rights following the shooting. He has visited the White House, met with President Trump and legislative leaders across party lines, and unveiled an app to prevent school shootings. He slammed Time magazine for not including supporters of the Second Amendment on the cover of their Parkland issue.Zion Kelly, 17, whose brother, Zaire, died during an armed robbery last year told The Washington Post the students from Parkland appear to be getting media attention because of the school they attend is in a predominantly white, affluent community.“This is happening over and over again. Dozens of students have been shot and killed — more than in Florida — and we’re not getting the same attention,” Kelly said. He attends Thurgood Marshall Academy, a charter school in Washington, D.C.“Daily Wire” editor Ben Shapiro told Fox News he has been contacted by students who are conflicted because they support both the Second Amendment and the school shooting victims.Shapiro said the media is “celebrating the marches, putting students in photo ops, or using as political human shields.”WATCH THE MARCH FOR OUR LIVES LIVE STREAM HEREHowever, the organizers of the march claim it is not political.The organizers claim the rally is not political.

94,"Raw video: Andrew Pollack, whose 15-year-old daughter Meadow was killed in massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, says news network is too focused on gun control when they should be focused on school security.The father of Florida school shooting victim Meadow Pollack slammed the “fake news” media for focusing on gun control rather than calling for an increase in school security — including backing President Trump’s call for arming teachers in classrooms.Speaking to Fox News after a news conference with Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday, Andrew Pollack said the primary focus is not about gun control, but about the safety of students at schools. Pollack specifically drew focus to CNN when a reporter interjected and placed a mic with the CNN logo in Pollack’s face during the interview.“If you turn this channel (CNN) all they’re talking about is gun control,” Pollack told Fox News while pointing to CNN’s mic. “It’s this fake news here that’s in my mouth here. All they want to do is ratings, gun control.”He added: “Right now it’s not about the control. It’s about the kids [who] are going to school Monday — we want them safe. Like I said, it’s not about (political) parties. We’re all humans we want kids safe.”FATHER OF FLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIM LAMBASTED ON TWITTER FOR WEARING 'TRUMP 2020' SHIRTThe CNN reporter then asked Pollack what he thought about the Florida school shooting survivors who are demanding “assault rifles off of the streets,” then asking him “why is that a bad idea.”Pollack responded: “I’m not focusing on that and I’m not a gun expert, so I can’t answer that. What I can answer is I just want kids safe.”Pollack said gun control is a “second tier” step and the big picture for the U.S., but that his current priority was about school safety.“So, I just want to make sure that when everyone out there drops their kid, they know, 'Hey, I checked the school personally and I’m telling you that school’s safe, no one is getting past the front door,’” Pollack said.“That’s my focus. I don’t wanna focus on anything else or what other news stations are focusing on. I focus on safe schools. That’s what this country should be focused on,” he added.TEEN SURVIVOR, FATHER OF PARKLAND VICTIM CALL FOR CHANGE AFTER FLORIDA SCHOOL MASSACREPollack also appeared on CNN Wednesday morning to further explain his push for school safety and defended Trump’s call to arm teachers in an effort to make classrooms safer. Pollack attended a listening session at the White House last week where he urged the president and administration officials to focus on the safety of students. “So, what you’re telling me is fake, or whatever you’re hearing is incorrect,” Pollack began telling CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota. Pollack explained Trump’s proposed program would allow any teacher to train on how to properly use guns in the event of a shooting incident.“This is America, and it’s freedom of choice. You have the choice to go to any school you want,” Pollack said. “If you don’t want a teacher or a marshal or someone with a gun at your school, you go to a gun-free school zone. You take your kid, and go to a school that has gun-free.”""I focus on safe schools that’s what this country should be focused on.""Pollack has been vocal about lobbying for better school safety since the Valentine’s Day shooting that killed 17 people, including his 18-year-old daughter, Meadow. Pollack said his daughter's death gave him “extra strength” to push for change. He said he hopes his daughter is the last child to die in a deadly school shooting.“I don’t want anyone ever to go through what I have to go through every day (since Meadow's death),"" Pollack said.Pollack was also lambasted on Twitter hours after his daughter died when a photo of him wearing a “Trump 2020” shirt surfaced. He was photographed during his search for his daughter, whom he later found out had died in the shooting.Katherine Lam is a breaking and trending news digital producer for Fox News.

But it’s powerful and won’t accidentally kill a kid,” he continued. “Trust me, this will stop anybody in their tracks.”The Democrat then proceeded to close his eyes and began spraying the pepper spray in his face. He’s later seen trying to wash off his face by dunking his head into water and spraying himself with a hose. “It’s incredibly painful, now I can’t see anything,” he said. “Wow, that’s intense.”Tillemann, a former Department of Energy official during the presidency of Barack Obama, made gun control the key issue of his campaign, doubling-down on his website that pepper spray should be “be made widely available as quickly as possible” for teachers and school officials to combat potential school shooters.“The time has come to move beyond apologies and half measures and fight for real solutions to gun violence in our community. Help us win this fight,” he said.PELOSI DEFENDS HOYER AFTER AUDIOTAPE SUGGESTS INTERFERENCE IN HOUSE RACEThis isn’t the first time Tillemann caught the attention. He secretly recorded Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer back in December, who urged him to drop out of the primary race to give way to Jason Crow, who was backed by the party’s establishment.“Yeah, I’m for Crow,” Hoyer was reportedly recorded saying at the December meeting in a Denver hotel. “I am for Crow because a judgment was made very early on. I didn’t participate in the decision.”He added: “But it was clear that it was our policy and our hope that, early on, try to come to an agreement on a candidate that we thought could win the general, and to give that candidate all the help we could give them.”Tillemann’s stunt is unlikely to earn him the party’s nomination as Crow remains the leading candidate in the primary race.Lukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

                                A survivor of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who was previously interviewed by CNN and MSNBC following the mass shooting, told Fox News he believes certain media outlets are politicizing the tragedy to push gun control.Brandon Minoff, an 18-year-old senior, said the media chose to target gun control advocates instead of focusing on the 17 lives lost in Wednesday's slaughter.“I wholeheartedly believe that the media is politicizing this tragedy,” Minoff said. “It seems that gun control laws is the major topic of conversation rather than focusing on the bigger issue of 17 innocent lives being taken at the hands of another human.”FLORIDA SHOOTING SURVIVOR: CNN GAVE ME ‘SCRIPTED’ QUESTION FOR TOWN HALL, QUASHED QUESTION ON ARMED GUARDSMinoff said students at the school are well-meaning and passionate on both sides of the contentious gun issue. At least 100 students from the school were expected to march in front of the State Capital in Tallahassee on Wednesday to demand stricter gun laws. Dozens of his classmates have willingly approached reporters and anchors to advocate for what they see as solutions to stop the school shooting epidemic. But Minoff said not all of the students at the school share the same stance -- yet most of the coverage has ignored those who favor gun rights.“I know many people who are pro-gun and others who support gun control but it seems that the media is specifically targeting those in support of gun control to make it seem as if they are the majority, and the liberal news outlets are the ones that seem to make the bigger effort to speak to these people, and I'm talking from experience,” said Minoff, who was interviewed on cable news in primetime.Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used the media to speak out against gun violence after a killer murdered 17 people at their school.Minoff, who had a class with shooter Nikolas Cruz during his sophomore year, was outside when Cruz started firing. Minoff's brother, Aiden, was inside and heard the shots.  But Minoff said as soon as the gunfire stopped, the gun control push began.“After getting home Wednesday night, three hours after the shooting took place, sitting on the couch and putting on the news, it pained me to hear conversations of gun control laws as I had just luckily escaped one of the deadliest school shootings in US history,"" Minoff said.MSNBC’s Brian Williams asked Minoff what he would do as a lawmaker to stop school shootings. Minoff immediately replied that banning guns just creates a higher demand for them, and contended the real issue is mental health reform.A screenshot of the ""March for Our Lives"" website with their mission statement.

The next day, Minoff said he watched as CNN again focused on gun control even as the shooter's troubling mental health history -- and missed warning signs -- began to emerge.“And all day Thursday, CNN was interviewing gun experts and specialists to brainwash the audience that gun control is a necessity,” he said. “They even have an army of my classmates trying to persuade other students that guns are unnecessary and should be illegal.”A makeshift memorial is seen outside the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and faculty were killed.

Minoff said he supports the First Amendment rights of his classmates, but he believes many of them are uninformed about guns and are just going along with the perceived popular opinion.He pointed out that on the “March For Our Lives” website the mission statement says “We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the life of students.” But, he noted, an assault rifle is an automatic weapon, and there wasn’t an assault rifle used in the Florida shooting -- rather Cruz was armed with an AR-15.Like many of his classmates, Minoff wants to make changes so this doesn’t happen again, and he hopes to meet with President Trump to discuss solutions.Minoff supports some regulations when it comes to purchasing firearms, such as age restrictions and more extensive background checks that include police reports -- especially given the police were called to the Cruz residence nearly 40 times before the shooting occurred.“I would also talk about the importance of arming security guards and other trained individuals in schools,"" he said. ""The only armed person in the school, the SRO, was reportedly nowhere to be found during the time of the attack and it shows in the fact that Cruz managed to vacate the school unscathed.""FLORIDA TEACHER OF THE YEAR’S GUN VIOLENCE POST GOES VIRAL AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTINGHe added: ""At the same time, [security guard and] Coach Aaron Feis had a face-to-face altercation with Cruz and was unable to do anything but use his body to shield others.

102,"Supreme Court nominee discusses rulings involving amendmentA legislative response to mass killings is elusive on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers cannot settle on a solution. However, there are lots of alternatives when it comes to potentially curbing gun violence.Background checks. Banning so-called “bump stocks” or regulating them. Increasing open-carry provisions. Or just leaving things the way they are.But would any fix the problem?Taking action on any plan entails compromise. So far, the sides just aren’t willing to do that. And in a paradoxical twist, the butchery in Las Vegas last week may give Republicans the chance to pass controversial firearm legislation of their own, which Democrats vehemently oppose.

Let’s start with Rep. Carlos Curbelo, the Florida Republican who is rolling out a ban to bar “bump stocks.”“After so many years of trying to reach a bipartisan compromise on gun legislation, it looks like we may have a breakthrough here,” Curbelo said recently on the Fox Business Channel.But closely parse the statement by the National Rifle Association on the “bump stock” issue.“The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,” said the NRA.At first blush, some perceived the statement as a departure from the NRA’s usual hardline stand. But the group says it may be in order for “additional regulations” for “bump stocks,” not a prohibition.That’s where the compromise part gets hard.Would lawmakers like Curbelo -- and probably a host of Democrats -- be willing to compromise on “bump stocks” if it didn’t prohibit them but just imposed more regulations?Must it be a full-on ban? Would the NRA accept something beyond beefed-up regulations? And as long as we’re talking about “bump stocks,” wouldn’t Second Amendment-defending Republicans insist that Democrats compromise on something, too?How about permitting expanding concealed carry permits across state lines? What about the sportsman’s bill to make it easier to obtain suppressors and silencers? Isn’t that what compromise in Congress is all about? Accepting half-loaves? Horse-trading?House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2017.

“A background check is a compromise. There are many more things (congressional) members want to do,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “They’re going to say, ‘If you give them a bump stock, it’s going to be a slippery slope.’ I certainly hope so.”In other words, Democrats would insist on increased gun and accessory regulations beyond “bump stocks.” The NRA may worry that new policies would encroach on what they view as an absolute right on guns. They would argue that if Democrats are going to score some legislative success after the Las Vegas massacre, in which 58 were fatally shot and hundreds of others injured, shouldn’t Republicans get something as well?“The first response from some politicians has been to call for more gun control. Banning guns from law-abiding Americans based on the criminal act of a madman will do nothing to prevent future attacks,” the NRA statement also said.The U.S. is now embarking on the most intense conversation on gun violence since the slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Yet there are political and parliamentary truths that may again thwart any movement Democrats demand on firearms.After the murders at Sandy Hook, Pelosi charged Rep. Mike Thompson, a fellow California Democrat, with leading their party’s task force on gun violence.Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) speaks at a news conference about the recent shooting in Las Vegas outside the Capitol Building in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2017.

Thompson has long been around firearms, serving in the Army during Vietnam. He’s also a hunter and former co-chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus. Yet Thompson’s seen almost zero activity on the gun front since Pelosi tapped him for the task force.“If this majority believes that a ‘bump stock’ prohibition is enough, they've been smoking something,” Thompson fumed. “It doesn’t even come close.”But let’s say for a moment that there was legislation on the floor banning “bump stocks.” Would Democrats vote nay because they demand more on guns? What about accepting half a loaf?“I believe we need to prohibit ‘bump stocks,’ and if that’s the bill that’s in front of me, I’ll vote for that,” Thompson also said.The NRA is dug in. Republicans control the House and Senate. The NRA is closely-aligned with Republicans. That factor alone could be enough to disrupt any measure from hitting the floor of either body.“We don’t believe bans have ever worked on anything,” NRA Executive Director Chris Cox on Fox News’ “Fox News Sunday.” “What we have said has been very clear: that if something transfers a semi-automatic to function like fully-automatic, then it ought to be regulated differently.”Congress could consider gun legislation. But that could come at a “price” for what Democrats are pushing with firearms control. Here’s a look at an incongruous political and legislative reality on guns.Since June, House Republicans have tinkered a bill to make it easier to obtain “suppressors” that “silence” weapons. There is also a push to ease restrictions on concealed-carry permits across state lines.So, lawmakers do what lawmakers do: horse trade. Republicans could find some consensus on their side of the aisle on regulation of “bump stocks” -- not an outright ban. And then they throw in the provisions on silencers and concealed carry.Would Democrats vote for that? Maybe a few would. But Republicans could say they “acted” after Las Vegas and ask why Democrats wouldn’t come along to vote yes. Naturally, most Democrats would find the silencers and concealed carry add-ons as poison pills -- provisions that make the bill too toxic for them to vote aye.Yet ironically, something on “bump stocks” could make it easier for Republicans to include measures on silencers and concealed carry. Potential “bump stock” regulation actually gives the GOP a sheath of political cover.Then there’s the Senate. Two rounds of 60 votes are necessary to extinguish a filibuster on legislation. Think a gun bill of any sort -- “bump stocks” or no “bump stocks” -- can score 60 yeas when there are only 52 Republicans in the Senate? Could Republicans make such a vote challenging for moderate Democratic senators facing re-election next year in states where firearms are important? Maybe.Consider the pressure the NRA could apply to Democratic Sens. Jon Tester, Montanna; Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota; and Joe Manchin, West Virginia, to name a few.But that still doesn’t get you to 60 votes. Hence, the gun issue remains in legislative stasis.This is one reason why Democrats never get anywhere on the gun issue. But, there’s also a daunting political reality facing Republicans on firearms.President Trump repeatedly berates Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Twitter about eliminating the 60-vote threshold to kill filibusters on legislation. McConnell’s repeatedly resisted this entreaty. But lowering the bar would mean Republicans could muscle through any bill they want -- including something on guns.Altering the filibuster rules also means this: Democrats could very well draw up firearms legislation that actually gets all 48 of their members on board -- plus a few Republicans.It’s doubtful the NRA would embrace such a package. But a bill like that could certainly score 51 yeas rather than the 60 needed under current Senate operations.Moreover, what happens when Democrats again reclaim control of the Senate and Republicans cannot block them on gun bills? Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein, California, and Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, both from Connecticut, could then have their way with far more intrusive gun legislation than is politically possible now.Pelosi said a few days ago she hopes there’s a “slippery slope” on guns. Dropping the filibuster rule to 51 yeas would certainly grant Democrats the opportunity to do what they want with guns.Caveat emptor, President Trump.Solutions to gun violence? Few. Sure lots of alternatives though. And that’s why for now, Congress could again decline to move on gun legislation.",0
104,"PARIS –  Calls for greater gun control in the U.S. have reached as far as the Eiffel Tower, where 100 demonstrators demanded ""Protect children, not guns!""The crowd at Saturday's gathering in Paris included American and French demonstrators, families and students.Caitlin Waters, co-organizer of the March For Our Lives Paris gathering, says ""it's important for Americans even overseas to make sure that Washington knows that we're not pleased with the gun control reform and we want more.""The march is one of hundreds across the U.S. and the world to urge U.S. lawmakers to pass stricter gun safety legislation after deadly school shootings.It comes as France itself is shaken after four people were killed Friday in an extremist attack. Investigators are trying to determine how he got his weapon.",0
105,"Before the shooting had even stopped, teenagers hiding at their Florida high school were talking about gun control. Within days, they had launched a crusade against gun violence — one that will result in a nationwide series of protests Saturday.In taking up the fight, the students have joined forces with liberal organizations that have been pushing for years for tighter gun laws. That's led to criticism that the youngsters' cause is less spontaneous than it seems and that they are being used as pawns.Such suspicions infuriate the teenagers who have worked furiously since last month's massacre at their Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where 17 people died.They say they welcome financial help and assistance with certain basic, organizational tasks — after all, said Parkland junior Cameron Kasky, ""I'm 17. I can't rent a hotel room"" — but that the ideas behind the movement remain all theirs.""You can help us, but you're not going to run us,"" Kasky said. ""There are some things we're going to inevitably need help with. But our message, our organization, our platform — that's us.""He said as proof of his group's independence, it has turned down requests by some adult supporters to address Saturday's main march in Washington, preferring to reserve all speaking slots for youth.Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, contended the movement has been misrepresented as the spontaneous product of traumatized students.""This isn't just a few kids from a Parkland high school who started a national movement — they've been swept up in it,"" he said. ""The gun-prohibition movement in this country is pretty organized, and any time there's a tragedy, they jump on it and try to get the victims to work with them.""Longer-established gun control groups supporting the march chortle at the notion that they are the ones really in charge.""Everybody wonders who's the adult pulling the strings, and there really isn't one,"" said Peter Ambler, executive director of the organization created by former Rep. Gabby Giffords after she was shot in the head in 2010. ""This is an authentically student-led movement, from the message to the formation of the program, up and down.""Kasky recalled how in the days after the attack people kept asking him if George Soros was funding them. He said he didn't even recognize the name and had to look it up to find that they were referring to a liberal billionaire whose funding of several progressive groups is a favorite of conservative conspiracy theorists.Likewise, Kasky laughed off attacks connecting the students to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has been accused of anti-Semitism. The criticism came because the teens accepted help from the Women's March movement to organize student walkouts last week, and the co-president of the Women's March had met with Farrakhan. Kasky noted that most the students in his group are Jewish.Yet the Parkland students are in no way going it alone.The raw emotion and outrage they expressed over social media and at rallies after the Valentine's Day attack electrified supporters of gun control and opened wallets. They have raised more than $4 million to support the more than 800 scheduled marches, including donations from celebrities such as George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, as well as support from groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded and funded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.In groups like Everytown, the Parkland teens are getting support from a well-financed gun control movement that sprouted up after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, when 20 Connecticut first-graders and six adults were killed. After gun control legislation failed in the U.S. Senate, activists decided they needed to create a counterpart to the National Rifle Association's combination of financial heft and grassroots support.Everytown raised more than $70 million in 2016, the last year for which tax records are available, and has pushed gun control measures in several states with limited success. It helped get a background check ballot measure passed in Nevada in 2016 as well as laws in 25 states to prevent domestic abusers from owning firearms.""The turf has changed significantly before Parkland,"" said John Feinblatt, Everytown's president, noting last year's Virginia governor's race, won handily by Democrat Ralph Northam, a supporter of gun control in the NRA's home state.The Parkland students have been quick to seize their moment. First, they went to Tallahassee to lobby for gun control legislation at Florida's Capitol, where they were joined by Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. They traveled to Washington, met with senators and parents of children killed at Sandy Hook and got advice on activism from Rep. John Lewis, the Georgia congressman who was a stalwart of the civil rights movement. A pro bono attorney helped them set up a nonprofit to handle donations. They even have their own app.What happens after Saturday? Kasky said the students plan to launch a get-out-the-vote campaign targeting young voters.The students aren't the only ones benefiting from the energy they've injected into the gun control movement. Feinblatt said Everytown has received nearly 100,000 small donations since Parkland. Everytown and Giffords' organization are helping fund some of the ""sibling"" demonstrations around the country Saturday. The main march's web page directs supporters who want to make a tax deductible donation to an Everytown fund.Gottlieb, of the pro-gun group, said that the Parkland teens represent only one side of the debate among their generation and that they're being lionized by the media at the expense of peers who disagree. In fact, that's helped some pro-gun teens start to mobilize, he said: Youth memberships in his relatively small group have increased twelvefold since Parkland.""There's movement on both sides of the equation,"" Gottlieb said.___Riccardi reported from Denver.

109,"Students are demanding action in response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Griff Jenkins reports from Washington D.C.America continues to mourn the 17 people killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last month. There is an understandable emotional desire to “do something” in response – but without evaluating what the “something” will actually accomplish. This is the driving force behind the March for Our Lives taking place Saturday in Washington.The motivations of many people taking part in the Washington event and other demonstrations around the country are sincere. But before we “do something,” we need to stop and think: what is the most sensible thing we should do? What will actually save lives and make us safer?It’s important to understand that the debate isn’t between those who want to end violence and those who support gun rights. Both sides want to end violence. The debate is simply over how best to keep Americans safe.Supporting gun control is now the “in thing.” Stars such as Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus tweet their support. Time and Teen Vogue magazines run cover stories glorifying people working to put stricter controls on guns and ban some weapons. The New England Patriots used their team plane to fly students and families from Parkland, Florida, to Washington for Saturday’s gun control rally.You would be unlikely to know it from the media coverage of the Washington demonstration, but only 47 percent of Americans between 13 and 17 believe that more gun control could reduce mass public shootings.Britain’s Guardian newspaper asked students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for their ideas on how to end violence. The ideas sound good at first glance and are certainly well-meaning. But in reality, the policies being proposed will either have no effect or even cause harm.Here are four of those ideas, and a look at their actual impact:1. Ban semi-automatic weapons that fire high-velocity rounds.Gun control advocates say semi-automatic rifles are designed to kill people, not for hunting, target practice or self-protection. They say only members of our military need these guns.But looks can be deceiving. An AR-15 rifle shoots the same bullets as a small game-hunting rifle. Both guns fire one bullet at a time, and with the same velocity. The guns merely look different on the outside. AR-15s may resemble military weapons but they aren’t the same weapons used by soldiers.Semi-automatic rifles don’t just take lives, they also deter criminal attacks and save lives. In 95 percent of defensive gun uses, no shots are fired. But if you do have to open fire, having a semi-automatic weapon means that you won’t have to take the time to manually reload the gun. This additional time for the victim may make the difference between life and death.Banning all semi-automatic guns would endanger lives. So gun control advocates find it easier just to call for bans on the more scary-looking guns.2. Require national registration of guns.Gun control advocates have long claimed that gun registration will help solve crimes. Their reasoning is straightforward: A registered gun left at a crime scene can be used to identify the criminal.Unfortunately, it rarely works out this way. Criminals almost never leave behind guns that are registered to them. In the few cases where guns are left at the scene, it is because the criminals were killed or injured. And these guns are virtually never registered to the person who committed the crime. Many are stolen.During a 2013 deposition, the Washington, D.C., police chief said that she could not “recall any specific instance where registration records were used to determine who committed a crime.”When I testified before the Hawaii State Senate in 2000, the Honolulu chief of police also stated that he couldn’t find any crimes that had been solved due to registration and licensing.The chief also said that his officers spent about 50,000 hours each year on registering and licensing guns. This time is being taken away from traditional, time-tested law enforcement activities.Canada and other parts of the U.S. haven't had any better luck. TV shows depict gun registration as an effective crime-fighting tool, but this isn’t how things work in real life.3. Institute universal background checks and close gun show and secondhand sales loopholes.These are actually different words for the same thing. Background checks on private transfers of guns is the first policy gun control advocates call for after each mass public shooting. But such background checks would not have prevented a single mass public shooting in this century.In addition, over the years from 2000 to 2015, states that had universal background checks had twice the rate of mass public shootings as those that didn’t have that law. 4. Raise the firearm purchase age to 21.Let's not forget about the law-abiding young citizens who arm themselves for self-defense. What about the 20-year-old woman who is being stalked by a potential rapist or killer? Research shows that having a gun is by far the most effective way for young women to defend themselves.Of the 64 U.S. mass public shootings since 1998, 10 attacks were carried out by people under age 21 – five by people who were already too young to legally purchase their guns and five where increasing the age limit could make a difference. Even in the five cases where raising the age limit might have conceivably had an impact, it is likely that the shooters could have illegally obtained a weapon, just as many other attackers do.Prior to 1994, while some states had an age limit, there was no federal age requirement for buying a rifle. The only peer-reviewed study on this change was conducted by Thomas Marvell in the Journal of Law and Economics.Marvell concluded: “Where the 1994 laws seem to have an impact, the suggestion is almost always that crime increases; thus, there is no evidence that these bans had their intended effect.” In fact, Marvell found that the law was associated with a 6 percent increase in firearm homicides.Here’s a better ideaSo if the above ideas all have big problems, what can be done to more effectively protect children in school?Having more armed law enforcement officers and security guards in schools would be useful – but only if governments came up with additional money so that no other school programs are cut.Letting well-trained teachers and other school staff members carry concealed handguns if they wish is a much less expensive alternative. There are currently 18 states that have at least some schools where staff and teachers carry.There have been no problems or increases in insurance premiums at the schools with armed staff members. “From what I’ve seen in Utah, (school insurance) rates have not gone up because of guns being allowed,” says Curt Oda, former president of the Utah Association of Independent Insurance Agents. Nor has a survey of other states shown any increase in insurance costs.Armed school staff would be a final line of defense against school shooters. Importantly, they would also be a deterrent. They wouldn’t stop every school shooting, but they would most certainly save lives.Here’s the bottom line: We all want to save lives, but being well-meaning isn’t enough. The media’s one-sided coverage of the gun control debate gives the false impression that  only one side cares about saving lives and that virtually everyone agrees that the solution to gun violence is the strictest gun controls possible.Some have even called for banning all guns and eliminating people’s ability to defend their families and themselves. That would be a truly radical and extremely unwise step.Too much is at stake for politically correct decisions that sound good but are not sound policy.John R.

1,"A gun being handled by a young mother in a town outside Cleveland accidentally discharged, sending a bullet into her two-year-old daughter’s chest and killing her, police said Saturday.The mother, who investigators did not identify, owned the weapon legally and had a permit to carry a concealed gun, according to a statement from Wickliffe, Ohio, police.Police and paramedics were called late Friday to an Econo Lodge in Wickliffe where they tried to resuscitate the little girl. She was pronounced dead a short time later at a local hospital. Three siblings in the hotel were unhurt.“The safety was on when I dropped the gun and the bullet shot her,” the mother told a 911 dispatcher, Cleveland’s ABC-5 TV reported. “The gun dropped, I dropped my gun. She’s gone. My baby’s gone. She’s not breathing at all. She’s gone.”Wickliffe investigators issued a statement extending “condolences to the family of this beautiful little girl ... all indicators are that this is the result of a tragic accident.”An investigation is continuing. “The matter will be reviewed to determine what, if any, criminal charges should be filed,” said a police statement. “We are not releasing any names at this time as extended family is still being notified. This is truly a tragic situation; please keep this beautiful young child and her family in your thoughts and prayers.” It was a tragic addition to grim news this week concerning children and guns.Shazeem Hayes, 19, of South Carolina, was sentenced on Friday to eight years in prison for the death of his girlfriend’s son, 2-year-old Jacarion Gladden, who accidentally shot himself in the chest last year with Hayes’ 9-millimeter pistolIn Indiana, the father of a 3-year-old girl who accidentally shot and injured her pregnant mother faces trial on three felony counts.

That demonstration took place exactly one month after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that claimed 17 lives. Blackman took video, which he later uploaded to Twitter, showing that he was the sole person at his school to take part in last month’s 17-minute protest. “Hello, Twitter, there’s going to be like six people watching this hopefully,” he said in the video. “I’m the only one from my school out here.”On Friday, Blackman walked out again as part of a nationwide event to remember the Columbine shooting in Colorado and protest gun violence.

4,"LITTLETON, Colo. (Reuters) - Colorado gun control activists rallied on Thursday near Columbine High School, calling for an end to gun violence one day before the 19th anniversary of the massacre there and a planned nationwide student walkout.The roughly 200 demonstrators who gathered in the Denver suburb of Littleton on a windy afternoon included a survivor of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 dead.The walkouts and drive to sign up voters are aimed at pressuring U.S. politicians to enact tighter restrictions on gun sales in the run-up to November’s mid-term congressional elections.“The idea is to unite and empower survivors, to stand together,” said Emmy Adams, an 18-year-old senior at nearby Golden High School.On April 20, 1999 two Columbine seniors killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher before committing suicide. Since then mass shootings have occurred with shocking frequency across the United States.Among the speakers at the “Vote for Our Lives” event were Parkland High School student Carlitos Rodriguez, who told the crowd that politicians would listen if their seats were at stake.Students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions are expected to walk out of class at 10 a.m. local time on Friday, organizers say.Activists asked students to wear orange, the official color of the campaign against gun violence, and observe a 13-second silence to honor the victims killed at Columbine.Columbine has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre, a district spokeswoman said, so there would be no walkout at the school. Students were encouraged to take part in community service.The latest national rally comes more than a month after tens of thousands of students from some 3,000 schools participated in the #ENOUGH National School Walkout to demand that lawmakers seek tighter gun control regulations.It also follows “March For Our Lives” rallies in cities across the United States on March 24 that were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets to demand tighter gun laws.Dudley Brown, president of the Colorado-based National Association for Gun Rights, said the gun-control movement seeks to have the government take away rights, “precisely opposite of what the civil rights activists did in the 1960s.”“The main objective of these students is to ban firearms completely, and confiscate the firearms of law-abiding Americans,” Brown said. “We will oppose them at every step.”",1
5,"You may call Jason Aldean his own worst critic. The country star will often listen to his music over and over, or watch tapings of his performances. “I pick all my stuff apart. I listen to it a lot. But I do that with everything,” Aldean told HuffPost. If we have a live performance on TV, I go back and watch it and go, ‘I should have done this different or that different. Or I should have done this here.’ I analyze everything.” Aldean did that with his new album, “Rearview Town,” released on Friday. The title track, in particular, is one he analyzed a lot before releasing it. Though, now it appears he listens to it more for enjoyment that anything else. He likes its relatable premise about “leaving your hometown and putting the past behind you and moving on to something else down the road that maybe you couldn’t achieve in your hometown.”For his eighth studio album, Aldean wanted to “push the envelope,” similar to what he did with his self-titled debut in 2005. “Early on in my career when we would make records we had a little bit of an ‘anything goes’ mentality as far as songs, and finding songs that let us step outside the box — from what everybody else was doing,” he said. “I think on the last couple of albums we played it safe ... I just wanted to get back to finding and recording songs where people would never know what’s going to come next.”The new set of 15 songs includes a mix of sounds ranging from country and blues to rock and hip-hop. It also features an appearance by Miranda Lambert on “Drowns the Whiskey.” The two previously collaborated on “Grown Woman” from Aldean’s 2007 sophomore effort. The trickiest part this time involved making sure he found the right track to introduce to Lambert. “I actually sent her a song before I sent her ‘Drowns the Whiskey,’ and she just wasn’t loving it. She didn’t hate it. She didn’t love it. I told her if you’re going to sing on it, I want it to be something that you really like,” Aldean recalled. Luckily, Lambert fell in love with “Drowns the Whiskey.” It’s a more traditional song ― something right in her wheelhouse, Aldean said.“One thing a lot of people don’t know about her is that she’s a really great harmony singer. Like really good,” Aldean said. “She doesn’t necessarily sing it  like if I brought in a background singer. But that’s what makes it cool. It’s very stylistic, and you can tell that it’s her. We had her come in and cranked her into the mix and it sounded great. Highlight of the record for sure.” This album is Aldean’s first release since the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October. Aldean was performing onstage at the country music fest when a gunman started shooting from a nearby hotel room, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history.Although the new songs were neither influenced nor inspired by Vegas (he completed them prior to Route 91), Aldean does mention the victims and survivors of the massacre in the liner notes; he doesn’t want people to forget what happened that night. “I feel like a lot of times it becomes less and less of a headline as times goes on. For me, it was a way to acknowledge people that were there and let them know that a lot of time has passed now, but it’s still something I think about. I think about those people every day, and that night, I still think about all the time.”In the days after the shooting, Aldean visited hospitals and met with survivors, something that impacts him to this day. “I don’t think you can go through something like that and have it not change you. It’s a life-altering kind of thing. It made me view a lot of things differently,” he said. “I think going and talking to some of the victims and their families and seeing the spirit that those people had was pretty amazing to see. I was going through my own stuff in private and dealing with all of it. But to go talk to all the people and see the way they were dealing with it — that had been shot. They were in great spirits and just glad to be alive. I was like, ‘Oh man, maybe I’m looking at this all wrong.’ It really helped me have a different view on it. But it’s tough. I don’t know if you ever really get over it. Hopefully it gets better.”Since the Vegas shooting, a lot of talk has surrounded gun control ― with eyes on the country music community. Aldean, a gun owner himself, recently said it’s too easy to get guns.“When you can walk in somewhere and you can get one in five minutes, do a background check that takes five minutes, like how in-depth is that background check? Those are the issues I have. It’s not necessarily the guns themselves or that I don’t think people should have guns,” he told The Associated Press. “I have a lot of them.”But when pressed on the hot-button gun debate during our interview, Aldean didn’t want to elaborate. “I feel like it gets taken out of context, and the headline becomes that I speak out on gun control. ... I’m not saying that people should have their guns taken away,” he said. “Because I don’t think that. It’s just one of those things ― it’s like a no-win. For me, I’ve said my piece on that and people can take it for what they want to.”With that, Aldean wants to focus on his new music and his return to the stage, with a major tour kicking off in May. Playing live is still where he feels most at ease. “I know I’m not the best singer,” Aldean, ever the self-critic, said. “That’s my thing ― you put me onstage and you put me in front of people, that’s where I’m comfortable.” Now, more than a decade into his career, Aldean continues to attract a large audience. Over the weekend, he returned to Las Vegas for the Academy of Country Music Awards, where he took home Entertainer of the Year for the third consecutive time. “I feel like I’m able to pick songs that work for me,” he said about his success, adding, “and being able to work hard when you do get the opportunities and take advantage of things and be able to sustain it.” ",1
6,"Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) signed a set of new gun restrictions into law on Wednesday, fulfilling what he’s called his “moral and legal obligation and responsibility to provide for the safety of our citizens.”The legislative package raises the minimum age for purchasing a firearm to 21, enhances background check requirements for private gun sales, and bans high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. Other measures expand law enforcement’s ability to confiscate guns from individuals labeled an “extreme risk” and people arrested for domestic assault.At a signing ceremony in front of supporters and critics at the state capitol in Montpelier, Scott defended the new laws as an appropriate response to mass gun violence over the past year in places like Parkland, Florida, and Las Vegas.“Today we choose action over inaction, doing something over doing nothing, knowing there will always be more work to do, but today we chose to try,” Scott said. “This is not the time to do what’s easy, it’s time to do what’s right.”Gun advocates booed the governor and let out screams of “coward” and “traitor.”The modest overhaul of the state’s gun laws marks a significant change for Vermont, a blue state with a large rural population and a rich tradition of hunting and outdoor activity. Although lawmakers have debated gun control in the past, such measures historically haven’t received much support.Scott himself had previously toed the pro-gun line and carried an endorsement from Gun Owners of Vermont ahead of his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. In the hours after the Parkland shooting in February, he signaled that he wasn’t interested in revisiting Vermont’s gun laws, which are among the loosest in the nation. But he appeared to change course just a day later, following the Feb. 15 arrest of a Vermont teenager who had allegedly planned a similar shooting at a high school in Fair Haven, Vermont.The suspect in that case, an 18-year-old, was legally able to purchase a shotgun, but would not be allowed to do so under the new state law.“As governor, I have a responsibility to provide for the safety of our citizens, especially our kids,” Scott said at a February news conference announcing he’d be open to looking at gun policy reform.He echoed that sentiment in a March statement following the state legislature’s passage of the new gun restrictions, saying recent mass shootings had proven that “no state is immune to the risk of extreme violence.”Beginning Wednesday, Vermonters below the age of 21 will no longer be allowed to purchase firearms unless they can show they have completed a hunter safety course. The previous age restriction for long guns, including rifles like the AR-15, was 18 years old.The new limits on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines will also go into effect immediately. The restrictions apply to rifle magazines that hold more than 10 rounds or pistol magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. Dealers in the state have until Oct. 1 to sell any magazines they already have in stock.People with high-capacity magazines purchased before the law’s implementation are exempt from the legislation. Gun stores in Vermont reported an uptick in magazine sales ahead of Wednesday’s bill signing. At a rally earlier this month, firearms advocates handed out 1,200 free 30-round rifle magazines.With Scott’s signature, nearly all private gun sales in Vermont now require a background check conducted by a federally licensed firearms dealer. Transactions between family members will not be subject to the requirement.The new law also sets into motion a process for law enforcement to petition for “extreme risk protection orders,” which will allow police to confiscate firearms from individuals found to be dangerous to themselves or others.The state ban on bump stocks, the accessories the Las Vegas gunman attached to his semi-automatic rifles to allow them to simulate automatic fire, will go into effect on Oct. 1 and will prohibit all possession of the devices. Gun advocates have harshly criticized the new laws, arguing that they’ll infringe on the rights of otherwise law-abiding individuals while doing little to protect public safety. “The tyranny of democracy has overwhelmed the protections of my constitutional, individual rights,” Bill Moore, a firearms policy analyst for the Vermont Traditions Coalition, which lobbied against the gun measures, told The Associated Press.A number of pro-gun organizations in Vermont have vowed to challenge some of the new restrictions, including the ban on high-capacity magazines.Gun violence prevention groups have meanwhile lauded Scott for supporting what they see as reasonable reforms to state gun laws.“The cultural shift signified by having these laws in place will be hard for some, but the day-to-day experience of most law-abiding gun owners in Vermont will be impacted very little,” said Clai Lasher-Sommers, executive director of GunSense Vermont, in a statement.“The laws were crafted with respect for our state’s long-standing hunting culture, and are supported by gun owners and non-gun owners alike,” she added. “We appreciate the courage that the Governor has shown in recognizing a risk to his state and taking proactive measures.”",1
9,"Heading into the midterm elections, American voters are more likely to say they’re focused about health care than any other issue.Asked to select their top two issues from a list in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 30 percent of registered voters picked health care. An unusual trio of issues is tied for second place, with each named by about a quarter of voters as a top priority ― the economy, which perpetually ranks as a top campaign topic, but also gun policies, which rarely garner that level of attention, and immigration, a mainstay of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.This far from the election, of course, there’s still plenty of time for campaign narratives to develop and change. Voters’ midterm preferences are often driven more by partisanship than by policy, and this time around, Trump’s presence is likely to cast a heavy shadow over the results. But if health care plays a prominent role in this year’s election, as multiple polls have suggested it may, it’s another way the 2018 playing field could advantage Democrats. Health care, which likely contributed to Democrats’ midterm shellacking in 2010, is now an issue they feel free to embrace. For the first election cycle since its passage, a majority of the public now approves of President Obama’s signature health care law, and Democrats enjoy a sizable advantage over the GOP on handling related issues. For the party, “it’s an issue that you don’t have to hide from anymore,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Mollyann Brodie told HuffPost last fall.The poll also suggests that gun issues, which have long ranked low on Americans’ priority lists, are continuing to draw heightened attention in the wake of the Parkland shooting, especially among proponents of gun control.In contrast, the economy ― one of the relatively few bright spots for the GOP ― remains a top issue, but isn’t overwhelmingly at the front of public opinion the way it was in past elections. And tax reform, which Republicans had hoped would serve as a midterm asset, has stalled out in popularity and doesn’t appear to be at the top of voters’ minds.There are gaps on which issues each party views as important. Health care ranks highly on both sides of the aisle. But Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters are notably more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaning voters to say they’re motivated most strongly by President Trump’s record, while Republicans are far more likely to mention immigration and the economy.About half of all voters say they’ve seen gun policy and immigration mentioned in political advertisements or campaign mailers this year. Close to 40 percent say that they’ve seen President Trump’s record, health care, and the economy raised, while a third have seen tax reform come up.The survey also looks at which issues each party is perceived as focusing mostly on. In the case of the Democratic Party, that’s guns, followed by Trump’s record. In the case of the GOP, it’s taxes, immigration, and the economy. At times, a perceived mismatch between those issues and the topics on Americans’ minds has served as a warning sign ― in a poll taken just before a GOP wave swept the 2014 midterms, for instance, Republicans were seen as sharing voters’ worries about the economy, while more said Democrats were instead focused on social issues. This year, although neither party is overwhelmingly seen as concentrating on health care, twice as many voters say Democrats are focusing most on the topic as say that Republicans are. That gap could continue to grow, if races to date are any trend. In last year’s Virginia gubernatorial race, health care was “central” to Democrat Ralph Northam’s winning campaign, according to his pollster. A number of Democratic candidates, especially female ones, are following that example.Nearly 70 percent of voters say they’re following news about the midterms at least somewhat closely, and 30 percent that they’re paying very close attention. Forty percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, but just 23 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters, say they’re already paying very close attention.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 23-26 among U.S. adults, including 872 registered voters, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

11,"Nevada congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian suggested in a recent interview that the Armenian genocide could have been prevented had the Ottoman Empire not robbed Armenians of their guns.Tarkanian addressed the issue of gun control during a March 27 radio interview with conservative firebrand Wayne Allyn Root.“I happen to understand that the first thing Hitler did before he herded the Jews into concentration camps to kill them was he passed, I believe in ’38, a law that said no Jew could own a gun,” Root said. “In the end you’re powerless and defenseless if you have no gun.”Tarkanian, a perennial Republican candidate and vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, said the Holocaust was an example of “history repeating itself,” and pointed to the Armenian genocide. “I’m Armenian, and the Ottoman Empire ― they took the guns from the Armenians,” Tarkanian said. “They came and they killed 1.5 million of the 2 million that were there because they had no way to defend themselves.”Root agreed, and claimed that despots like Russia’s Joseph Stalin and Cambodia’s Pol Pot “always take the guns first.”Tarkarian and Root are correct that many mass killings throughout history followed the confiscation of guns. The Ottoman Empire passed gun control laws in 1911, about four years before the start of the Armenian genocide, and Armenians were required to surrender their weapons.But Armenians had been forbidden from owning weapons for hundreds of years and were the victims of religious persecution well before the 20th-century genocide. A pogrom in the late 19th century, which predated the gun control legislation, also resulted in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Armenians.A handful of conservative figures, including Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, have latched on to the claim that gun control legislation helped spur the Holocaust. In February, Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) also questioned how many Jews were “put in the ovens because they were unarmed.”Tarkanian has unsuccessfully run in state elections since 2004. Hours before the filing deadline for the 2018 midterms last month, Tarkanian dropped his bid to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R) and decided to run for a House seat instead. Trump had suggested Tarkanian make the move two days earlier:",1
12,"Pro-gun advocates rallied at the Vermont capitol over the weekend to protest a recently passed slate of gun laws, including a bill to implement universal background checks for all firearms purchases, raise the minimum gun purchase age to 21 years old, and ban the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity ammunition magazines.The magazine restriction has raised particularly strong opposition among the gun rights crowd, which has characterized it as an unnecessary measure filled with loopholes. But at the gathering in Montpelier on Saturday, pro-gun activists also worked to actively exploit those loopholes by giving out free high-capacity magazines.The scene followed a broader pattern of firearms enthusiasts criticizing gun control laws for being ineffective while subverting them out in the open. The laws could never work, the protest suggested, because we won’t let them.“It’s a classic case of gun rights hypocrisy,” said Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland who’s written five books on gun policy. “They’re publicly doing everything they can to undermine the law.”Chris Bradley, president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, kicked off the rally by blasting lawmakers for supporting what he called an “unenforceable” magazine ban. State law enforcement officials, including the attorney general, have also stated that the provision could be difficult to enforce.Minutes after Bradley spoke, Rob Curtis, the executive editor of Recoil Magazine, a gun lifestyle publication, began handing out 1,200 30-round magazines to the crowd. Curtis gave first priority to people under 21, who will be prohibited from purchasing ammunition magazines when the new law goes into effect, Bradley told HuffPost in an interview. Curtis did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Although the new law, S. 55, will prohibit the sale or transfer of any rifle magazine over 10 rounds and any handgun magazine over 15 rounds, it will not apply to the possession of any devices that are legally owned when the law takes effect. That means all of the high-capacity magazines given out on Saturday will remain legal.The grandfathering of certain devices is a broader point of contention in the debate over bans on firearms or related accessories — some state laws have banned possession outright, regardless of when equipment was acquired. Grandfather clauses can make magazine restrictions particularly hard to enforce because it’s almost impossible to know which devices were legally obtained before the ban.“Magazines are not serial-numbered, they are not marked with a date of manufacture, they may not even be marked with a manufacturer’s mark at all,” Bradley said.Bradley also noted that Vermont neighbors New Hampshire, where high-capacity magazines remain legal. Although it would be illegal to import outlawed devices across the border, once they make it to Vermont, law enforcement might not be able to differentiate between illegal magazines purchased after the ban and legal pre-ban magazines. Supporters of S. 55 admit there will be challenges in enforcing the magazine ban, but they maintain that it will succeed in limiting access to high-capacity magazines that can radically increase the lethality of a weapon.“We’re trying to tell law-abiding Vermonters to abide by this, and many, many of them will, but that doesn’t mean that all of them will,” said state Sen. Philip Baruth, who carries both Democratic and Progressive party labels.Baruth likened the effort to his previous campaign to prohibit cellphone use while driving. Although critics of that measure also argued it would be impossible to enforce, he said that over time, many Vermonters have come to accept that you shouldn’t be on the phone when you’re in the car, whether out of respect for the law or concern for public safety. Baruth hopes gun owners will show a similar willingness to comply with new laws.S. 55 will also allow authorities to crack down on vendors caught selling high-capacity magazines. Although the 1,200 new 30-round magazines given out over the weekend will make it a bit harder to keep tabs on these sorts of devices in general, over time, Baruth is confident the law will make them less ubiquitous and more difficult to get.And that’s exactly what Bradley is afraid of.“What they’re really hoping for is that down the road, as magazines start breaking, we’re not going to be able to replace them,” he said. “So, my generation’s protected, what about my son’s generation and my grandson’s generation?” Bradley argued that limiting magazine capacity infringes on a gun owner’s right to self-defense. He said the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs is in the process of assembling a legal team to figure out the next step forward. Previous legal challenges against high-capacity magazine bans have failed in federal court, so it’s unclear what sort of recourse gun supporters will have in Vermont.But Saturday’s magazine handout should serve as a reminder that some pro-gun advocates have little interest in engaging in a good-faith debate about the effectiveness of gun control. Vermont gun enthusiasts insisted that banning high-capacity magazines wouldn’t work, and were willing to sabotage the effort to help make their case.“It essentially shows their contempt for the law,” said SUNY Cortland professor Spitzer.To Baruth, Saturday’s show of resistance is proof that Vermont’s gun culture has become more radicalized over the past 25 years.“We used to be a rural deer-hunting culture, and gun manufacturers have sort of piggybacked on that to wed people to the idea that military-style weaponry is akin to the traditional Vermont lifestyle, and it’s not,” he said.A Wyoming-based firearms accessory manufacturer reportedly sent its magazines to Vermont for Saturday’s giveaway. Baruth argued that companies like this have a financial interest in preserving the sort of political environment in which people are free to be as “extreme in your gun rights position as possible.”“Nobody grew up in a Vermont where you could kill 58 people ... in under 10 minutes,” Baruth said, referring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas last October. The gunman in that incident was equipped with around a dozen semi-automatic rifles outfitted with 100-round magazines and bump stocks, which allowed him to simulate automatic fire as he rained down more than 1,100 rounds on concertgoers attending a country music festival.When S. 55 goes into effect, Vermont will join eight states and Washington, D.C., in restricting magazines of various sizes. The bill was part of a broader package of gun control legislation debated in the wake of the February school shooting in Parkland, Florida.The day after that massacre, a Vermont teenager was arrested on charges that he was planning a similar shooting at a high school in Fair Haven, Vermont. The suspect in that case, an 18-year-old, was legally able to purchase a shotgun, but would not be under the new state law.Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) has said he plans to sign S. 55 and other recently passed gun bills into law. In a statement last week, he said he understood that firearms advocates were “disappointed,” but maintained that the gun control measures were worthwhile initiatives.“I think at the end of the day, they’ll soon learn that what we have proposed, what’s being passed at this time, doesn’t intrude upon the 2nd Amendment,” he said. “It doesn’t take away guns, and I believe that we will get accustomed to the new normal, which is trying to address this underlying violence that we are seeing across the nation.”",1
13,"When survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting returned to classes after spring break on Monday, they were met with a slew of new security measures, including a widely resented policy: mandatory clear backpacks for everyone.Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting in February, were quick to express their disdain for their new accessory.Junior Cameron Kasky stuffed his backpack with tampons on Tuesday to protest what students have called an invasion of privacy.Senior Carmen Lo took a jab at Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the National Rifle Association by hanging a $1.05 orange price tag on her bag ― the value of the donations Rubio has accepted from the NRA divided by the number of students in Florida. “This backpack is probably worth more than my life,” read a note that Lo had penned and stuffed inside her bag.The idea of using clear backpacks in schools as a way to prevent gun violence is not new. Schools across the country have enforced similar rules since at least the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.But Stoneman Douglas students — many of whom have led a national call for stricter gun control — say the measure is only window dressing and does not actually address the problem of gun violence.“I hate the backpacks, and I think they solve nothing,” Alyssa Goldfarb, a 16-year-old sophomore, told Vice News. “It’s more of a way of the county saying, ‘Hey, we’re doing something.’”As students pushed back against the new backpack rule this week, Robert Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, said the policy was “an initial measure, not a permanent one.”He told the Sun-Sentinel that the district may eventually allow other backpacks and that officials were determining the best methods to keep students safe in the long term, including the possible use of metal-detecting wands.A district spokeswoman told the paper that officials were still exploring the idea of using such wands. “No decision or date has been set for [their] use,” she said.Besides the backpacks, other security measures — including increased police presence and a requirement that students wear an ID tag at all times — have been introduced at Stoneman Douglas since the February massacre.Though some students say they do feel safer with the new policies in place, several said this week that the school environment now feels stifling and “like jail.” “I definitely feel safer, but in no way is school going to be a place of cognitive education and creativity when it feels like a jail cell,” junior Jack Macleod told CNN.",1
15,"WASHINGTON — Student activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School inspired hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets last month to call attention to gun violence. Many protesters seemed to have their sights set on this year’s midterm elections, as they carried signs alluding to their voting power and arguing that politicians backed by the National Rifle Association needed to be voted out of office. But anti-gun violence advocacy groups say there is one more test: whether the momentum that led students to organize the March For Our Lives in the nation’s capital can continue until Election Day in November. “The issue is, are kids going to show up to vote?” said Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “Because that’s the banner of success for us.”Voter turnout is traditionally lower for young people and during midterm election years.“We need to make sure when voters vote in November, that this is something they’re voting on,” said Shannon Watts, co-founder of Moms Demand Action.Both Watts and Brown pointed to last year’s gubernatorial election in Virginia as a promising blueprint for electoral success. Exit polls showed that guns were the second most important issue for voters, behind only health care. Now-Gov. Ralph Northam (D), as well as Democratic candidates on the local level, used gun control as an issue to their advantage; Democrats and gun safety advocacy groups successfully made the NRA’s support for Northam’s opponent, Ed Gillespie, a political liability.Stoneman Douglas students from Parkland, Florida, and the people they’ve inspired seem intent on keeping the issue of gun violence front and center in the coming weeks: Marches and rallies have continued, and there are plans for a nationwide school walkout on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre. Victoria Kaplan, organizing director for MoveOn.org, said she considers those steps “really strong indicators” that political engagement will continue through November — and perhaps far beyond.Many of these advocacy groups are now collaborating with the students on further political engagement, such as making it easier for them to attend lawmakers’ town halls — while bearing in mind that “they’re the ones with agency here,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, the group co-founded by gun violence survivor and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).“Given the failure of adults to protect kids, the kids are understandably suspicious of the adults, so it’s really important that you approach young people as partners,” Ambler said, noting that students planned the March For Our Lives without being asked. Several of the gun control advocates emphasized that the student activists have already started to build a sustainable, long-term political movement. The urgency and personal nature of the issue, they said, is likely to continue to motivate young people.“This active shooter generation, they’re coming of age — and they’re pissed,” Ambler said.Brown said frequent lockdown and mass shooter drills at schools around the country have shown kids what needs to change. “For many kids, this is how they grew up, and it’s a reminder, every time they go through it, of how little has been done to truly protect them,” Brown said. “The answer that the adults have put into place, they know, really, is not going to stop it from happening again.”“I don’t see them just walking away from this,” she added. “This is something that’s deeply personal, like, ‘You’ve told me this is the way our government is supposed to work. I see that this is — pardon my French — a bastardization of it. Fix it, and if you’re not going to fix it, then get out of the way.’”A major motivator is students’ visceral anger at “the corruption of our political system,” as Ambler characterized it.“The NRA is a really good bad guy for folks, and kids naturally understand that money in politics has had insidious effects on the direction that our country takes politically,” he said. “It just seems obvious [to them].”Kaplan noted that the Parkland students have tried to make their movement inclusive and show just how many people are regularly affected by gun violence: They have put attention on shootings in urban areas where people of color predominantly live, and have spoken out about their own experiences in mostly white suburban areas.The students’ “complete frustration and almost righteous indignation” with the government, as Brown put it, has a recent historical parallel: activism against the Iraq War, which reshaped the Democratic Party and catalyzed a generation of progressive leaders.It is too early to say whether students motivated by gun violence now will go on to run for office, but Ambler said he sees the seeds being planted.“You’ve got a generation of Americans that is engaging politically for the very first time in their lives. We probably all remember that moment when politics became more significant for us, right?” he said. “For me, it was the Iraq War, when I was a senior in college, when I saw exactly how important political engagement was. I think for this generation, that’s happening through the lens of gun violence. The impact of that is going to ripple for years.”Kaplan, who was also a college student during the anti-Iraq War movement, said she believes today’s students will stay active.“Once young people start down this path, it’s hard to get off of it,” she said. “I think they’ve already determined their commitment and what it’s going to take to win, so really, it’s in their hands.”",1
16,"The message at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington this weekend was clear: Gun violence isn’t just a problem of mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month. Nor is it isolated to the bloodshed that tears through cities on a daily basis, or to other routine shootings often tied to mental health, domestic violence or police intervention.Gun violence is an all of the above issue.As speakers took the stage on Saturday ― none of them above the age of 19 ― they offered differing perspectives on the many ways guns affect individuals and communities alike.This diversity shouldn’t have come as a shock to anyone following the Stoneman Douglas students as they prepared for the event. In the lead-up to the rally, they spoke out about their own privilege and the need to broaden their scope beyond the mass shootings that rarely, but explosively, strike affluent communities like theirs. They met with students from Chicago and Washington to discuss what gun violence looks like to them, and how best to confront it.The lineup of speakers seemed like proof the Parkland students weren’t just talking the talk. They had worked to make their movement genuinely inclusive, both in terms of race and socioeconomic class, and in its embodiment of the varied experiences of gun violence around the nation.But now comes the hard part for the March for Our Lives movement. As it evolves beyond activism and into more concrete advocacy, the students face the challenge of crafting an agenda that continues to embrace inclusivity while working toward solutions to tackle gun violence in all of its forms.“Gun violence is such a local issue,” said Paul John, leader of the New York City chapter of Million Hoodies, a racial justice group. “Whereas some communities may have more of an issue with domestic violence, certain suburbs may have been impacted my mass shootings, others by suicide.”Each of those problems requires a different set of tools to address. When it comes to urban gun violence in particular, which accounts for a disproportionate share of overall shootings, it can be a challenge to get people outside the affected communities to understand how pervasive and deeply intertwined the issue is with other structural inequities that have long plagued inner-city neighborhoods, John said.“It’s going to be important for the young Parkland students to realize how complex gun violence really is and take steps toward being more informed as to how gun violence affects communities around the country,” he said.The March For Our Lives campaign has already identified a number of policy objectives, including universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 style rifle used in Parkland. But to those who have been actively involved in community-based gun violence prevention efforts, prescriptions like these are far from a catch-all.“We all agree gun laws are a good start, but we really need to look more comprehensively at what it is that causes people to act out violently,” said Miguel Dominguez, director of youth programs at Community Coalition, a social justice nonprofit in Los Angeles.Lamar Johnson, the violence prevention coordinator for BRAVE (Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere), based out of St. Sabina Parish in Chicago, sees it similarly.“We have legislation and we have tough gun laws, but what we don’t have is investment in our community,” he said.A decadeslong lack of investment in neighborhoods in Chicago and Los Angeles has helped feed a “culture of violence,” said Johnson. With little funding for schools, businesses and social services, many local kids suffer from a lack of opportunity, which serves as a pipeline into the sorts of criminal activity that often leads to shootings.Both Community Coalition and BRAVE take a holistic approach to violence prevention, providing outreach to youth to give them the skills and resources they need to resist the traps that can lead them down these roads in the first place. Youth leaders from both organizations spoke on Saturday to offer a window into the realities they face. Edna Chavez, a 17-year-old from Los Angeles, recalled learning how to “duck from bullets” before she could read. Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old from Chicago, reminded the crowd that “everyday shootings are everyday problems.” Chavez and Bosley both lost brothers to gun violence.Johnson said he was happy to see those voices represented at the March for Our Lives, but he noted that initiatives like BRAVE need more than just a larger stage from which to tell their stories.“People figure they gave us a platform to speak so they did their due diligence, which is like a slap to the face, because giving me a microphone means nothing if you’re not going to give me the funding and the resources for my youth program and violence prevention programs,” said Johnson. “We still have to go back into this crime element we live in every day.” St. Sabina has seen an uptick in calls from interested donors since Bosley’s speech, said Johnson. But so far, there have been no celebrities or high-dollar donations ― no Oprah, or George and Amal Clooney, who together donated $1 million to the March for Our Lives.“We’re still pushing for that and we still need that and that’s why we’re trying to publicize it as much as possible to say, it’s not just in Chicago but in all the urban cities across America that have the same issues,” said Johnson.Johnson added that his BRAVE members have remained in touch with the Parkland students, and that they’ve discussed additional events for the summer, when violence in Chicago and in many cities tends to spike.The March for Our Lives students will need to continue actively fostering this collaboration if they want to keep their movement truly inclusive, said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of Community Justice Reform Coalition, a national advocacy group focused on gun violence prevention. Goodwin said this sort of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.“Plugging in with groups that are already doing the local work is really important,” she said. “It’s a great way to show partnership, but also to meet people where they’re already at, versus asking people to come to where folks in the gun violence prevention space have been for so long.”A crucial part of this alliance will involve the Parkland kids simply listening to the concerns of other communities and using their input to inform the movement’s agenda, said Goodwin. Policies can have different effects and connotations for different groups of people, and solutions that appeal to some may seem dangerous to others.That disparity was on display in Parkland this week, where a group of black Stoneman Douglas students spoke out, explaining that the increased police presence at school since the shooting made them uncomfortable. They also said they felt they’d been left out of conversations about the local response to the massacre.This sort of oversight has cropped up in the national gun violence prevention movement as well, said Goodwin, who previously worked for the gun control organization launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). She said many groups working on the issue been “siloed,” which has meant marginalized communities have sometimes not had “the self-determination and the space” to be able to advocate for their specific needs.The March for Our Lives was an all-too-rare example of what it looks like when these communities are given that opportunity, said Goodwin. She advised the Stoneman Douglas students to continue reaching out to elected officials and organizations that center communities of color, and to take advantage of existing local partnerships and gun violence prevention programs that have already shown tangible results.“This has to be an intersectional issue,” said Goodwin. “But it’s not just a matter of saying that things are not diverse and that we need diversity and inclusion; it’s actually going to be dismantling a lot of the systems that have been built.”That won’t be an easy task, Goodwin admits, which is one reason she believes the young organizers behind March for Our Lives shouldn’t be afraid to lean on adults for their experience and expertise.“Yes, young people should lead, but we should be thinking about how we do this inter-generationally, where we’re looking at the strategies that have worked for more seasoned organizers,” she said.But even if the March for Our Lives students do dedicate themselves to building and strengthening these sort of partnerships, many of the obstacles for local gun violence prevention efforts will remain. Getting the necessary resources and support needed for them to succeed is a constant struggle, said Paul of Million Hoodies.“Many times, the local governments are strapped for funding to implement these strategies ... so being able to bring in private funding and being able to bring in people who are looking to support gun violence prevention organizations on a consistent basis is key,” he said.With a massive platform, the March for Our Lives organizers may be able to help channel resources toward those initiatives.Another way the March for Our Lives movement can champion these causes is through the ballot. Organizers made a big push to register voters at the weekend rallies, and the Parkland students have made the November elections a key focal point in the movement.But activists want young people to know that it’s not just a matter of backing members of Congress who support gun reform. It’s also about mayors, city councilmembers and other local officials who, in some ways, have more direct power to address gun violence in their communities.Although the Parkland students have a lot of work ahead to ensure that their movement can deliver on the promising vision laid out on Saturday, John is cautiously optimistic that they’ll be able to succeed where others have failed.“Generation after generation, you see people become at least a little more radical in their thinking of how to change the world,” he said. “These young folks, I think, are much more willing to work together than I’ve seen historically in this movement.”",1
19,"The megaphone was heavy, the Florida sun was beating down on my face, and my knees were shaking uncontrollably. Meanwhile, my adrenaline was working overtime as I scanned the crowd for any signs of danger. My voice was hoarse from shouting from the podium and my heart was pounding.This was what change felt like, and I had never been prouder in my life.On March 2, I helped lead the community of students at Seminole High School in Sanford, Florida, who walked out of class in protest of the U.S. government’s failure to undertake gun reform after the Parkland shooting.Located only a few hours upstate from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, my school is attended by many students who personally knew people affected by the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. Furthermore, we’d lost an alum from our school at the Pulse nightclub massacre less than two years ago. Needless to say, we had had enough.Because, if we’re being honest, teenagers are often overlooked, talked down to or ignored by our society. I was determined to change this attitude by inspiring my fellow students to embrace our potential as our country’s future leaders. The walkout, which initially existed as a rumor floating around campus, became a concrete event when I and several student activists took matters into our own hands. We formed a Snapchat group to coordinate our efforts. Social media was our secret weapon and most powerful tool in bringing together the student body.For a week, we planned. We met with our administration and enlisted the help of our city’s police to ensure the safety of all student protesters. Most importantly, we crafted the theme of our protest: not loud noise, but loud speech. Not empty anger, but deliberate change. Not embitterment, but empowerment.And so, my friend Mike and I printed 400 copies of letters addressed to our senator, Marco Rubio, and state representative, Jason Brodeur. In the letters, we included specific policies we wanted our leaders to support ― including repealing the Dickey Amendment, reinstating the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, refusing ALEC legislation at the federal level, and ending the gun show loophole at the state level ― to prove that we had done our research and that we meant business. At the bottom of each letter, we provided space (and plenty of Sharpie markers!) for students to voice their concerns.We also hoped to honor the lives lost in Parkland and to stand in solidarity with the survivors of the shooting. Each of the organizers wore a black shirt bearing a picture of one of the victims. I chose to wear the face and name of Carmen Schentrup, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I had read that Carmen was a National Merit finalist, but her letter arrived the day after she died. Carmen’s death felt like a personal loss to me, because next year I will be receiving my own National Merit letter ― the same letter Carmen should’ve gotten, but never will. And to me, that is unthinkable.In spite of our grief, Friday morning felt perfect: one of those bright, sunny, summer-vacation-in-Florida days that makes you feel like anything is possible. The hallways were bursting with excitement, the classrooms were flooded with students carrying signs and wearing orange. During our last organizers’ meeting at lunchtime, the news vans arrived. When they weren’t permitted to enter the school, they mounted their cameras on helicopters. To me, that felt like proof that our plan was working, because we had gotten people’s attention. It was finally our moment.With 10 minutes left to go before the walkout, we tested out the megaphone one last time. We took a deep breath, reassured each other that everything would be fine, and climbed up onto a wall in our school courtyard. And then it was game on.All at once, students and teachers started pouring into the courtyard, coming out of classrooms and cafeterias, all of us proudly bearing our signs. Whenever I thought they had stopped arriving, another set of doors opened and another group of students burst out, and soon, the courtyard was filled. We did that, I remember thinking numbly. We’re all here.After a brief moment of silence in honor of the victims, my fellow activists spoke out to the crowd, using the megaphone that we had borrowed from the school band. One of my friends recited a spoken word poem, and another recited an open letter to Rubio. And then the megaphone was in my hand, and I was looking out at the crowd, and my knees began to shake because the possibility had just occurred to me that anyone could have a gun, but now wasn’t the time to back down.I lifted up the megaphone and spoke my truth. “We Vote Next,” which had been the rallying cry of my speech, was taken up by the entire crowd, because that kind of empowerment is contagious.I couldn’t tell you what happened after that, even though my speech has since been featured all over students’ social media. Really, all I remember is feeling more alive and in control than I ever had in my life. In that moment, I forgot that I was nervous and scared. In that moment, I felt bulletproof. I felt like the future.When the rally was over, the rest of the afternoon passed in a blur. I remember walking off campus to be interviewed by local TV stations. (My friends were later upset that the evening news had spelled my name wrong, but such is the struggle of being young, brown and woke.)Really, what I learned from the walkout was simple: It’s crucial to always stand up for what you believe in, and when you have a passion, you run ― or in my case, walk ― with it. True activism requires thought and deliberation, not just anger. And at the end of the day, together we are stronger than any bullet.We have to be.",1
21,"Harley-Davidson Inc. announced it is shifting production of some of its motorcycles to Europe because of President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war, which critics warn could hamstring the humming U.S. economy and cost jobs.Trump hosted executives from the Milwaukee-based company and the union officials representing its workers last year at the White House. The president hailed the company as a model of American manufacturing, an industry he promised to restore. He further praised the executives “for building things in America” and predicted the company would expand its operations during his administration.Things aren’t looking so great for the iconic motorcycle producer this year, however. The company said in a regulatory filing on Monday that retaliatory tariffs imposed on American exports by the European Union rose between 6 percent and 31 percent this year, resulting in a jump in $2,200 per average motorcycle exported to the EU.But rather than hike prices in the U.S., the company said it would absorb the cost in the short term ― projected to be some $30 million to $45 million through this year― and shift some production to international factories in coming months.“Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company’s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. Europe is a critical market for Harley-Davidson,” the company said in a statement.The move follows a round of layoffs at the company’s manufacturing plants in Milwaukee and Kansas City, Missouri, last year, costing 180 manufacturing jobs.Trump tweeted Monday that he was “surprised” by Harley-Davidson’s decision to move some production overseas, urging the company to be “patient.”Trump on Friday further threatened to escalate a trade war with Europe by imposing a 20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports of EU-assembled cars.Republican leaders in Congress have so far resisted challenging Trump on trade, worrying that an intraparty clash could harm the party in November’s midterm elections. But there are signs that some members of the president’s party ― which historically has favored free trade ― may finally be reaching a breaking point. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), for example, warned over the weekend that he’s prepared to oppose Trump’s judicial nominees unless the Senate votes on legislation curtailing the president’s power to unilaterally impose tariffs on other countries.“I think myself and a number of senators, at least a few of us, will stand up and say, ‘Let’s not move any more judges until we get a vote, for example, on tariffs,’” Flake, who is retiring this year, said on ABC’s “This Week.”This story has been updated with Trump’s Monday tweet.",1
22,"CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta was heckled at President Donald Trump’s rally in South Carolina on Monday as members of the crowd chanted “Go home!” and “CNN sucks!”Acosta was reportedly waiting in the press area at the rally in West Columbia, where the president was about to campaign for the state’s Republican Gov. Henry McMaster. But before Trump arrived, attendees holding signs reading “CNN fake news” began chanting for the reporter to leave the venue. At one point, a woman pointed at the journalist, repeating “Take him out” and urging her fellow rally-goers to heckle him.Acosta attempted to shake the woman’s hand, telling her he had a right to cover the event. He then said that he respected the United States as the woman waved her arms at him.“No! You do not respect it,” the woman yelled.Acosta later addressed the event on CNN.“While we have had people come up to us and be nice, I did have an elderly woman come up to me just a short while ago,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “She came up to me and said that we at CNN should get the ‘f’ out of this auditorium. She then turned to the crowd and whipped them up into a frenzy.”He continued: “We are here to do our jobs and report the news and report on this rally, and we’re not going anywhere.”Later in the evening, Trump began his speech on a familiar note, attacking the press and calling media outlets gathered at the rally “fake news,” a taunt that drew raucous boos and jeers. “The enemy, the enemy of the people I call ’em,” the president said of the media.Despite his continued attacks on CNN, he appeared to set his sights on a new target following an exchange of barbs with late-night host Jimmy Fallon this week. “NBC is worse actually than CNN,” Trump quipped.Acosta has often earned the ire of the president and other White House officials, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, over the past year. Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, recently called for the journalist’s press credentials to be suspended after Acosta shouted questions at Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a summit in Singapore earlier this month.“Dear Brad.. dictatorships take away press credentials,” Acosta fired back on Twitter. “Not democracies.”",1

And if you haven’t seen it, now is your chance to finally catch up with the American zeitgeist.“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” joins on June 26. The movie earned well over $1 billion at the box office and only debuted in theaters last December. It’s fairly rare that Netflix adds such a recently popular movie, so this is a particularly noteworthy addition.If you’ve already seen the movie or simply aren’t a fan of “Star Wars,” Netflix does have a few other movies joining this week.“Mohawk” is probably your best bet. It’s a horror movie that focuses on a violent cat-and-mouse game between Native Americans and members of the early American military.Another streaming option is “TAU,” a horror offering about humans who are forced to help an AI computer get smarter by completing painful tasks. With hope of escape diminishing, the captives try to fight back against their robot captor. Check out the trailer for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” below (although you’ve likely already seen it, as the YouTube version alone has over 50 million views).And if you want to stay informed about what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter. This is part of Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies.

Yes.There have been hilarious efforts to claim this movie is terrible. (An especially funny example is the “Remake The Last Jedi” campaign featured in the tweet below.)But “The Last Jedi” is easily one of the best “Star Wars” movies in the franchise. It’s the only one that truly rises to seek answers to the philosophical questions so many have looked to these movies for in the past. What is the nature of good and evil in war? How should religion inform a well-lived life? Is a world with extreme haves and have-nots morally corrupt?As with all of the “Star Wars” movies, there are minor problems, of course. Characters act like idiotic children too often. Elements of the plot don’t hold up with much scrutiny.Still, this is an extremely fun and thoughtful movie. So many scenes are beautifully shot. The action sequences are thrilling. Despite the long runtime, it’s a movie well worth watching.Runtime: 2 hours, 32 minutesHere’s the trailer ...June 26 June 29  June 30",1
26,"Both Democrats and Republicans are pushing back against recent remarks made by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).At a Los Angeles rally on Saturday, Waters warned members of Trump’s Cabinet to be prepared for an onslaught of outrage wherever they go should they continue to support the administration’s controversial zero tolerance policy on undocumented immigrants.“You think we’re rallying now? You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said Waters, whose remarks came one day after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant because of her role in the Trump administration. “Already you have members of your Cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants ... protesters taking up at their house saying ‘no peace, no sleep.’”Waters took it a step further to encourage rally attendees to “make sure we show up wherever we have to show up.”“If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” the congresswoman said.Over the weekend, Sanders tweeted about getting kicked out of The Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia, after the owner said she had concerns about serving someone affiliated with the administration. In recent weeks, senior adviser Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were also confronted while dining.The incident involving Sanders and Waters’ response to it are now creating a larger conversation about civility and its place in politics.On Sunday, “The View” host Meghan McCain called Waters’ impassioned speech “extremely dangerous.”“This is absolutely insane,” McCain tweeted, later inciting the famous former FLOTUS Michelle Obama quote: “Don’t ever again give me any of the ‘when they go low, we go high’ lip service.”McCain’s sentiments were echoed by many members of the GOP and several journalists on a panel on CNN Monday morning.RealClearPolitics editor A.B. Stoddard said Waters is “doing everything she can to prevent her own promotion” as chair of the Financial Services Committee.“This is beyond overreach,” Stoddard said during the panel of her comments. “It is so outrageous that she is trying to motivate voters on her side to be as divisive as President Trump. I just find it really unbelievable that this is the kind of thing they’re trying to stoke this mob mentality on the left. It’s the exact thing that will drive turnout on the other side.”White House reporter Brian Karem, who has gone head-to-head with Sanders before, said he “would have served her.”“What happened to just a little bit of civility?” he asked.On Monday, House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added fuel to that fire and tweeted that while Waters’ response to the incident might have been predictable, it’s “unacceptable.” President Donald Trump tweeted in response to Waters’ remarks on Monday, calling the congresswoman an “extraordinarily low IQ person.” He also suggested Waters encouraged people to harm his supporters, when she did not.Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday on the House floor that he “strongly” disagrees “with those who advocate harassing folks who disagree with you.”“No one should call for the harassment of political opponents,” he said.When discussing the Red Hen incident on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said he thinks the Virginia restaurant owner should have served Sanders.Cummings did not mention Waters specifically but discussed his disapproval for the current incivility in politics.“This tone is horrible. But again, I think President Trump has created this,” Cummings said. “Since he became president and even before, he has basically given people license to state things that are ugly.”This article has been updated with comment from Schumer. ",1

29,"President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his Justice Department would proceed with plans to ban bump stocks, the firearms accessories the Las Vegas gunman used during his October attack on a country music festival that left 58 dead and hundreds more injured.Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed Trump’s announcement on Friday with a statement saying he’d filed a proposed rules change that would “effectively” make the devices illegal under federal law.The moves mark Trump’s latest step toward unilaterally outlawing bump stocks and other similar accessories, which he’s repeatedly vowed to do in the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month.The president’s announcement came a day before the highly anticipated March for Our Lives, a well-attended series of rallies against gun violence on Saturday that was organized by student survivors of the Parkland shooting.Although Trump didn’t personally address the movement from his golf resort in Mar-a-Lago, where he spent the weekend, his decision to roll out new action on bump stocks may have been an effort to send a message that he is doing something on guns ― and in particular, a modest measure that receives broad bipartisan support. To get a better sense of the long and potentially difficult road ahead, let’s take a closer look at what’s going on with this effort.First, it’s important to understand that bump stocks are not firearms. A bump stock is a component, typically made of plastic, that replaces a rifle’s standard stock and harnesses the gun’s recoil to slide the firearm back and forth onto the shooter’s trigger finger, allowing it to fire like an automatic weapon. (In the image below, the bump stock is the piece resting against the shooter’s shoulder.)Federal law strictly regulates private ownership of automatic firearms, which the 1934 National Firearms Act defines as “machineguns.” But in most states, anyone who can buy a gun can get a semi-automatic rifle and a bump stock.Although firearms equipped with bump stocks may fire like so-called “machineguns,” federal law specifically defines that term as any weapon that can “shoot automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.”The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has previously determined that it does not have the authority to regulate bump stocks because they don’t fit this definition. Not only are bump stocks not firearms, but because the accessories still require users to pull the trigger each time they fire a cartridge, the agency has ruled that automatic firing is not technically activated by “single function of the trigger.”The Trump administration now wants the ATF to change its determination. In his statement Friday, Sessions laid out a proposal to amend the regulations and clarify that bump stocks fall within the definition of “machinegun” under federal law, claiming that they do allow semi-automatic firearms to initiate a “continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.”Because bump stocks ”[allow] the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter,” according to the document, “a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger.”It’s not yet clear if this attempt to change the reading of federal law will pass muster. Critics from across the political spectrum believe the administration’s move is likely to face a legal challenge and may ultimately be struck down.Others have argued that Congress should act instead, and change the federal statute on machine guns to specifically cover bump stocks and similar devices. Although congressional lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation to prohibit such accessories, the National Rifle Association and a number of Republicans have said they’d prefer that the ATF handle the matter by simply changing its ruling.GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have opted not to take up the bump stock issue, allowing them to duck accusations that they’re considering a gun ban.It remains to be seen how this will all play out, but if Trump is ultimately successful in his effort to ban bump stocks, it will take a while. Although Sessions filed his Notice of Proposed Rulemaking last week, it hadn’t been published in the Federal Register as of Monday. Justice Department officials expect that to happen sometime this week, initiating a 90-day comment period for members of the public.At the end of that three-month window, the Justice Department must decide whether or not to proceed with a Final Rule. If it does, it must post that document in the Federal Register as well, in which it would lay out an effective date to be “no  less  than  thirty  days ” after publication.In the best-case scenario for the Trump administration, it would be at least four months before bump stocks are officially banned. At that point, anyone in possession of a bump stock or similar accessory would “be required to surrender, destroy, or otherwise render the devices permanently inoperable,” or be subject to stiff penalties under federal law, including imprisonment of up to 10 years or a fine of up to $250,000.",1

32,"Dozens of Wisconsin high school students are spending their spring breaks this week walking more than 50 miles to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) hometown of Janesville to deliver a message: Pass meaningful gun reform legislation now.A group of students from Shorewood High School, roughly four miles north of Milwaukee, organized the march to call out Ryan for blocking gun legislation reform and to demand lawmakers take immediate action to curb gun violence.“We started 50 Miles More to keep the national demand for gun reform going after the March 24th March for Our Lives events are over,” according to the movement’s website. “Our generation has grown up watching school shootings destroy lives and then get swept out of the spotlight. We refuse to let this happen again.”It’s no coincidence that the four-day, 54-mile trek from Madison began Sunday ― exactly 53 years after Martin Luther King Jr. led thousands of civil rights activists into Montgomery, Alabama, to conclude a five-day, 54-mile march that began in Selma.“We looked to history and an earlier generation of young leaders who fueled real change,” the 50 Miles More website says. “In 1965, civil rights leaders organized the multi-day, 54-mile Selma to Montgomery marches. Those 54 long miles took us a long way toward progress, and are the inspiration for our march.”March participation swelled to at least 40 young people by Monday, with students across Wisconsin joining the journey. At the end of every mile walked, the 50 More Miles participants honor a victim of gun violence. The march is expected to end Wednesday with a rally in Janesville.“We’re definitely a little sore in the feet and in some of the joints, but our spirits are high,” Brendan Fardella, a 17-year-old student at Shorewood High School, told HuffPost by phone Monday as he marched through the “middle of nowhere.”“This is definitely what I’d like to be doing on my spring break,” he said. “It wasn’t my original plan, but I’m much happier doing this and effecting some change with my fellow students than just being on a beach somewhere.”The marchers have been subjected to a few negative statements from passing drivers and bikers but overall have felt supported, said Alemitu Caldart, who also attends Shorewood High School.“We just respond by saying, ‘Spread love, not hate,’” Alemitu, 15, told HuffPost.“[We hope] to show people that we’re not done until actual change is made,” added Alemitu, who plans to participate in a spoken-word performance about gun violence at the rally in Janesville. “We’re still here. We’re stubborn. We’re going to keep on fighting for our lives to be safe every single day.”Asked by HuffPost for comment on the march, a spokeswoman for Ryan said he “respects those expressing their views.” “The House recently enacted new laws to keep children safe without infringing on constitutional rights,” she added.But the legislation she likely referred to, which includes expanding federal background checks for gun purchases, is only a tiny step forward when it comes to the reform proposals pushed by many firearm safety advocates. The 50 Miles More movement laid out a heftier list of demands on their website:Military-style weapons, and all weapons of war, should be banned from civilian society.All accessories that turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons, such as bump stocks, should be banned.Four-day waiting period on all gun purchases.Require background checks on all gun sales.Raise the legal purchasing age of all guns to 21“I stand here today to say to all of you that now is the time to do the impossible,” Katie Eder, an 18-year-old organizer of the march, said Saturday in a speech at Milwaukee’s March for Our Lives. “If the politicians won’t listen to us, if the politicians won’t make the change, then come November, we are prepared to change the politicians.”This article has been updated with quotes from students participating in the march. ",1
