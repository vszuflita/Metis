0,"Polly Darton by a country fence, looking over 13 carrots, laid out in a row) Polly Darton: Oh, hi there. My name is Polly Darton, and I'd like to sing a song for you, but I can't. The song I'd like to sing's called, ""14 Carrot Love"", but as you can see, I only have (slowly counting carrots) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 carrots. Mm-hmm. (Benny Rabbit, with a carrot in his mouth, hops by behind her, and then stops to look on) How can I sing a song about 14 carrot love, when I only have 13 carrots? (she notices Benny) Benny: Uh-oh. (tries to sneak away) Polly Darton: Look! Did you see that bunny with that carrot? (Benny stops, looking skyward, his escape foiled) I wonder if he'd let me borrow it. (calls) Here bunny, bunny, bunny! Benny: (spitting out the carrot) Hey! Don't call me Bunny! The name is Benny! Polly Darton: Well, I'm sorry, Benny. I was wondering if I could borrow that carrot there. Benny: (shocked) No! No way, no chance! No how! This is my carrot, and I gotta get downtown, so goodbye! (picks up carrot in his mouth again) Polly Darton: Oh please? You have one carrot and I have 13 carrots. (Benny puts carrot back down) If I add your carrot and my 13, I'll have (slowly counting carrots) 1, 2... Benny: Yeah yeah yeah... Polly Darton: ...3, 4... Benny: Come on, I gotta get downtown!

Polly Darton: Aw, please? Don't do it for me - do it for the little children! Please? Benny: (Squeaks his teeth as he thinks about it) Oh, all right all right all right. You can borrow my carrot. But you have to give it back. And you can't, I say you can't nibble on it, okay? Polly Darton: Okay, okay. Thank you! Thank you, you - Benny: Yeah yeah yeah... Polly Darton: ...wonderful little bunny, you! Benny: (appalled) Don't call me Bunny! The name is BENNY!!! (music starts, she now sings) Polly Darton: These carrots from the garden
Are gathered as you see
In one great big bunch
As pretty as can be Benny: (unimpressed) Yeah... Polly Darton: The bunch has 13 carrots
But it only takes a shove (Benny starts getting into the beat) To add another carrot
And get 14 carrot love! 14 carrot love! (Benny starts squeaking his teeth in time to the music) 14 carrot love!
That is what we got here -
14 carrot love!
It's better than some flowers
Or candy on a ring (Benny's really getting into it) And it's all 'cause of you-ou
I have this song to sing Together: 14 carrot love!
14 carrot love!
That's what we got here -
14 carrot love! (music ends, but Benny keeps singing, leaning back on the fence) Benny: 14 carrot love! 14 carrot love! Polly Darton: (calling to him) Hey hey! Benny! Song's over, Benny! Benny: (still singing) That's what we've got here! 14 ca- (stops) Oh yeah yeah yeah, right right, well I gotta go anyway. Yeah yeah, I'm just gonna take my carrot here, and get outta here ... Polly Darton: Hey, hey you can have all those carrots, Benny. Just my way of sayin' thank you. Benny: (blown away) Oh! Oh gee, well, um ... but I don't know what to say!

Voice #2: A bark?

Voice #2: Okay, but it's awfully dark out here.

4,"Okay everybody, I'm gonna tell you about some birthday parties I've been to
And when I get to the ""Happy Birthday"" part, well,
I want you to say ""Happy Birthday"" the same way the animals said it at the party
Here we go! A cat had a birthday and all the cats came
To eat cat cake and play a cat game
To open cat presents and when they were through
They said ""Happy Birthday"" the way cats do And they said, ""Meow, meow, meow""
Everybody do it now, ""Meow, meow, meow""
Really nothing to it, ""Meow, meow, meow""
Well image that, you've just said ""Happy Birthday"" in cat
That's what you did! A duck had a birthday and all the ducks came

Really nothing to it, ""Quack, quack, quack""
Well the ducks are in luck, you've just said ""Happy Birthday"" in duck Now when a rooster wants to say ""Happy Birthday"" to you

To eat cow cake and play a cow game
To open cow presents and when they were through
They said ""Happy Birthday"" the way cows do And they said, ""Moo, moo, moo""

5,"A face can be up
A face can be down
A face can be as funny as the face of a clown A face can show just how you feel inside
When your eyes open up
And your smile opens wide Your eyes could be brown
Your eyes could be blue
But there's never ever any other face just like you When you're sad or crying
And you don't know what to do--
Somebody's face can happen along
And smile the sunshine back into you A face can show just how you feel inside
When your eyes open up
And your smile opens wide Your eyes could be brown
(Or) Your eyes could be blue
But there's never ever any other face just like you When you're sad or crying
And you don't know what to do--
Somebody's face can happen along
And smile the sunshine back into you",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Face lyrics
6,"Olivia: In the winter, springtime, and fall ...
In the summertime, I call you a friend for all seasons.
A friend, so many reasons why I like to be with you.
Just like nature, we change, too. (Here, I think David sings something, then repeats what Olivia sang) David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: My friend! David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: My friend! David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: My friend! David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: Winter is cold, the ice and the snow. David: Springtime is warm; we watch the flowers grow. Olivia: And the hot sun of summer makes us throw away our cares. David: Autumn leaves ... (maybe something about frosty air?)",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Friend For All Seasons lyrics
7,"Be kind to the river
Be good to the trees
Smile at the sunshine
And bow to the breeze
Say ""thanks for the perfume""
Of every flower you sniff
What a world
What a place
What a gift Respect the deer and buffalo
The lion and tiger too
Be kind to dogs and pussycats
And they'll be kind to you
Take care of the forest
And fish in the sea
Look after the beetle
The ant and the bee
Say ""thanks for the raindrops""
And all the clouds that drift
They're for you
They're for me
They're a gift They're for you
They're for me
They're for everyone
They're a gift",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Gift lyrics

There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole. At this point Liza takes the chair and goes off to live with her mother which is probably what Henry wanted in the first place! ** The original version has the bucket to be thatched with hay that ends up being too long and needs to be cut with a knife that ends up being too dull instead of the Sesame Street version that replaces this with plugging the hole with a stick that needs to be cut down because it is too big, but the hatchet ends up being too dull to do the work.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Hole In The Bucket lyrics

She wrote a letter to a friend in China Dear Ling Lu,
How are you?
I love my bike.
Love, Dinah The letter went out in the afternoon mail
It went by truck, it went by rail
It was a loaded on a boat on its way to China
All the way from South Carolina
When the letter got to China it was loaded on a van
And a man took the letter to Ling Lu San
Ling Lu wrote a letter back to Dinah
And sent it off to South Carolina Dear Dinah,
How are you?

A little more later on
Watching all the good things grow
That's how the world goes on

And you see all the good things growing better every day",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Little Bit (at The Beginning) lyrics

50,"Oh what a joy
Watching life passing by and
Being a pig What could compare
To a home in a sty and
Being a pig Days are sunny and rosy
Things are comfy and cozy
With all the piggies around
What greater joy could be found Wallow awhile
In the mud that's my style
And being a pig Slurping that slop
Hey to me that's the top
And being a pig And when Mama is able
She sets a fine table
We gather around for a treat
And wow do we eat! And when the night has come creeping
In the barn we go sleeping
Who would know that pleasure gets this big!
Being a pig

Being a pig Goodnight",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Being A Pig lyrics

See what you want to see,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Go where you want to go,
Do what you want to do
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Some folks try to tell you there are things you shouldn't do
You're not strong enough or smart enough at all,
But what seems right to them quite often
Might be wrong for you,
So be sure you try to climb
Before you get too scared you fall. Oh, you can be what you want to be,
Learn what you want to learn,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Try what you need to try,
No one should question why,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Folks may say you're different,
That you've gone and lost your senses,
But the world is yours to walk in,
Go ahead and leap the fences. And you'll see,
Believe in yourself
And the world belongs to you and me",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Believe In Yourself lyrics

Bert: Okay, smart guy, you watch your ol' TV. I'm going to play a record anyway.

Ernie: Yeah, Bert, it's really dark.
Bert: Well, of course it's dark, Ernie. It's supposed to be dark. It's night out.
Ernie: No, Bert, I mean it's really dark. (Goes to the window.) See, the lights are all out on Sesame Street.
Bert (goes to the window): Hey, you're right, Ernie, it's really dark. I wonder why it's so dark ... Oh, I know what it is.
Ernie: Why is it so dark, Bert?
Bert: It's probably a blackout.
Ernie: Well, what's a blackout, Bert?
Bert: Well ... well, that's when the electric company has a breakdown, and then all the lights go out, 'cause you need electricity for lights. But they're probably trying to fix it, so just go to bed, Ernie. Nothing to do about it. (Goes back to bed.)
Ernie (pauses, still standing by the window): Bert ... are you scared of the dark, Bert?
Bert (sleepily): No, Ernie, I'm not scared of the dark.

Bert (irritated): Ernie ... (Sits up in bed.) Stop hitting me, Ernie! (Ernie stops.) Let me tell me you something. You can not watch television, because television needs electricity. And we don't have any electricity because of the blackout. So just go to sleep, Ernie. (Lies down.)
Ernie (starts shaking Bert after another pause): How about we listen to the radio, Bert?
Bert (sitting up): Ernie, it's the same thing with the radio! The radio needs electricity, just like the TV set. And we have no electricity because of the blackout. So just please GO TO SLEEP!

Boy, do I need it now. (Lies down. The phone rings once on the other end, and Oscar answers it. Note: Both Bert and Ernie can understand what he's saying.)

55,"Once upon a time, there lived a boy named Bert. One day Bert traded the family bicycle for a bag of magic beans.
But Bert's buddy, Ernie, looked in the bag and said, ""Beans? Blah! How boring."" And he threw the boring beans out the back window.
Immediately, the beans began to bloom. By breakfast, they had blossomed into a big, beautiful beanstalk.
When Ernie saw the beanstalk he said, ""Look. A big, beautiful beanstalk. That's really boring.""
But Bert wasn't a bit bored. ""I feel brave!"" Bert bellowed. So he bounded up the beanstalk.
Up, up, up went Bert, beyond the bean blossoms, beyond the birds, beyond the blue ... until he came to a big black building.
The building belonged to a giant named Burly Barney. Burly Barney was in the bedroom eating his breakfast of bushels of buttered buns, barrels of blueberries and bunches of bananas. When Bert saw how big Burly Barney was, Bert beat it to the back room. There, Bert found a big basket. It was full of bottlecaps.
""Boy, oh boy, oh boy!"" said Bert. ""Bottlecaps! I collect bottlecaps!"" So Bert brought the basket of bottlecaps back to the beanstalk.
But Burly Barney saw Bert, and he began to bellow. ""You took my bottlecaps!"" ""I'd better beat it,"" said Bert.
Boldly, Bert climbed down. Barney bounded down behind him. But, on a bottom branch, Bert slipped and fell with a bump.
""I'll bet you want to bash me because I borrowed your basket of bottlecaps,"" blurted Bert.
""Are you batty?"" bellowed Burly Barney. ""Those bottlecaps are boring! They were driving me bananas! Thank you for borrowing my bottlecaps!""
And Burly Barney shook Bert's hand. In fact, he shook Bert's whole body. Then Barney bounded back up the beanstalk to his beautiful black building.
And now that the basket of bottlecaps belonged to Bert, Bert had the best and biggest bunch of bottlecaps on the block. So Bert was beaming.
And everyone lived blissfully ever after. Except Ernie ... who was bored.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Bert And The Beanstalk lyrics

For once, I know he's not going to wake me up. No surprises, just peace and quiet. I'll just settle in under my blanket and go to sleep. Music starts playing Perhaps I spoke too soon! Door opens and sheep start coming in the room Sheep: Baaa, come on he's not asheep yet!
We just thought you might like to know where your blanket came from. Bert: My blanket? I know where my blanket came from! Sheep: A blanket begins in a faraway place
Where skies are blue and there's lots of space
The nights are cold and we sleep outside
To keep warm and toasty we grow hair on our hide
But when spring comes round the weather is warm
A thick woolly coat loses all of its charm
We're itchy and hot 'till the rancher arrives
To give us each a haircut and brighten up our lives
He grabs a big bag and he gathers the wool
And he stuffs and he crams 'till the bags are full
He throws 'em on the truck 'till it's piled up high
Then he climbs into the driver's seat and says ""goodbye"" That's the story of Bert's blanket
That's the story of Bert's blanket
That's the story of Bert's blanket Bert: Hey sheep! Hey sheep, aren't ya going to tell what happens next? Sheep: Oh so I suppose someone waves a magic wand and POOF!
Our wool turns into a blanket and lands on your beeeeeed Bert: Nooooo, that's not what happens to your wool. Now listen,
It goes to a mill before it lands in bed
'Cause it's gotta be twirled into long strong thread
Then it's gotta get dyed to a nice dull grey
Then woven into cloth before it's sent on its way
Get the picture? Sheep: Yes we see Bert: Well there's more
A few more touches and it goes to a store
Where it's put on a shelf, it's not long before
A warm grey blanket catches someone's eye
He says ""Hey, that's the blanket I've been longing to buy!"" Sheep: Well I'll be dagnabbed. So that's what happens! Bert: So when you climb in bed before you go to sleep
As you snuggle in your covers please think of these sheep Sheep: We'll be back on the range and doing our beeeest
To keep those blankets coming from our ranch in the weeest That's the story of Bert's blanket (repeated) Bert: Hey it's kinda late for you guys to be heading for your ranch,
There's plenty of room here if you'd like to sleep over,

Boo-hoo, wah-wah, sob-sob, (sniff)
Boo-hoo, wah-wah, sob-sob, (sniff) We can cry loud
We can cry low

A little cry can do you good!
Fill the air!
Chill your mood!
A little cry can do you good

67,"Eyes are nice, and so are lips
And also hair and finger tips
But dearer to my heart
Is my favorite body part I love a big round nose
A nose to smell a rose
I love a nose that's cute
And sweet and small
A nose that helps you sneeze
A nose to give a little squeeze Yes, I'm fond of almost any nose at all Oh, I love a turned up nose
Just give me one of those
A nose to breathe the air
So clear and fine
To breathe and sneeze and smell
That's what a nose does well
I'm so glad to know my nose is mine",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Big Round Nose lyrics

But you've got to count my blue suede shoes (gotta gotta) That's one, two

69,"You pick yourself a berry
And you put it in a bucket
Pick yourself another
Plump and juicy and new
Pick yourself a handful
Too yummy for the bucket
Squoosh 'em in your mouth
Until it all turns blue You've got blueberry mouth
Yummy blueberry mouth
Juicy blueberry mouth
Nothing so squooshy and sweet Pick yourself a berry
Save it in a basket
Pick 'em in the sunshine
All golden and hot
Pick yourself a handful
Who cares about that basket
Chew 'em up and swallow 'emmmmm
What have you got You've got blueberry mouth
Yummy blueberry mouth
Scrumptious blueberry mouth
Nothing so squooshy and sweet Pick yourself a berry
For your basket or your bucket
Pick yourself a handful
Roll 'em 'round in your hand
Pick yourself a mouthful
Need no basket and no bucket
The pleasure that you've got
Is even sweeter than you'll find Blueberry mouth
Yummy blueberry mouth
A scrumptious blueberry mouth
Nothing so squooshy and sweet Blueberry mouth!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Blueberry Mouth lyrics
70,"Feel your fingers, feel your toes
Grab your elbow, pinch your nose
Touch your ankle, tap your knees
Give your chin a little squeeze
You'll feel something hard inside
And it can not be denied
What you feel seems hard as stone
And it's something called the bone Oh there are bones, bones, bones, bones
Bones inside of you
Bones, bones, bones, bones
More than just a few
So many you can count them
Amazing but it's true
There are bones, bones, bones, bones
Bones inside of you There are bones inside your hand
In your feet to help you stand
In your elbow and your heel
Lots of lovely bones to feel
Though your bones are hard to see
Still you have them just like me
They are not outside but in
Yes they're underneath your skin Yes there are bones, bones, bones, bones
Bones inside of you
Bones, bones, bones, bones
More than just a few
So many you can count them
Amazing but it's true
There are bones, bones, bones, bones
Bones inside of you (spoken)
Now, when you put all those bones together, you may come up with something we call a skeleton. Remember that word, it's one of my favourites. And now, boys and girls, I will tell you what happens if you didn't have any bones ... (sung)
If you had no bones at all
Then you couldn't run or crawl
And you couldn't stand up straight
Or eat dinner off your plate
Without bones we'd all fall down
Just like puddles on the ground
Just like melted ice-cream cones
If we didn't have our bones Yes, there are bones, bones, bones, bones
Bones inside of you
Bones, bones, bones, bones
More than just a few
So many you can count them
Amazing but it's true
There are bones, bones, bones, bones
Bones inside of you (spoken)
And now the most fun of all, I will count all the bones I can think of. The toe bone, that's one, the heel bone is two, the ankle bone is three, shin bone, four, knee bone, five, hip bone, six, rib bones that's seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven .... I love counting bones, ah, ah, ah, ah!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Bones (inside Of You) lyrics
71,"When we're roamin' the streets and we see one car
We always add one and make it two
It don't matter why we like to add one and one
Out here it's the thing to do
Now some say that screaming ""one plus one"" all night
Means we're thoughtless, cruel, and bad
But kids like you and me baby, we were born to add Yes, sir, we were! As we keep on wandering we see two trash cans
So we add one and make it three
There's a lot of us adders on the Jersey Shore
Out here it's the thing to be
Yeah, we'll keep on shoutin' ""one plus two""
Even though it makes 'em mad
'Cos kids like you and me, baby, we were born to add That's your fate, baby
Take it, Clarice! One and two and
Three police persons spring out of the shadows
Round the corner comes one more
And we scream into that bitter night, ""hey, three plus one makes four""!
Well, they seemed to think we're disturbin' the peace
But we won't let 'em make us sad
'Cos kids like you and me, baby, we were born to add Baby we were born to add!
Baby we were born to add!
Add! Add! Add!
Baby we were born to add!
Add! Add! Add!
Baby we were born to add!
Oh, add
Baby we were born to add!
Baby we were born to add!
Add, add, add, add, add!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Born To Add lyrics
72,"Me want a soft boiled cookie
And a glass of cookie juice on the side
Or for a change one morning
Me will have cookies scrambled or fried It isn't hard each morning
To keep me satisfied
Just give me a soft-boiled cookie
And a glass of cookie juice on the side Sometimes I have a bowl of some crunchy cereal I'd even have some orange juice too
On other days my favorite is boiled eggs and toast
And sometimes a stack of pancakes is the breakfast I love most I'd drink a glass of milk or a cup of cocoa
Or even have a cup of tea
So many things a fella can eat for breakfast
That's why breakfast is so much fun for me",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Breakfast Time lyrics

74,"Oh, when I'm in my bubbly tub
A funny thing happens to me when I scrub
I splash and I wash and then it comes along
And soon I'm a'gigglin' and a'singin' this song Oh a bubble on my snuffle
While I'm taking my bath
A bubble on my snuffle
Is making me laugh
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, he
A bubble on my snuffle
Is tickling me
I said, a bubble on my snuffle
Is tickling me It's the silliest sight you've ever seen When a snuffleupagus is gettin' clean
No bath is better, I suppose
Then when there's a bubble on the end of your nose! Yeah, a bubble on my snuffle
While I'm taking my bath
A bubble on my snuffle
Is making me laugh
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, he
A bubble on my snuffle
Is tickling me

Is tickling me",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Bubble On My Snuffle lyrics
75,"If what I am is what's in me
Then I'll stay strong that's who I'll be
And I will always be the best
Me that I can be Oh I'm going to keep my head up high
Keep on reaching high
Never going to quite
Just keep getting stronger What I am is
What I am is
What I am is
What I am is
What I am is",Sesame Street,will.i.am What. Am lyrics
76,"It's not that easy being green
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer being red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colourful like that It's not easy being green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over
'Cause you're not standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky But green's the colour of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder
But why wonder, why wonder?
I'm green, and it'll do fine
And it's beautiful
And I think it's what I want to be",Sesame Street,Glee Cast Bein' Green lyrics
