0,"Polly Darton by a country fence, looking over 13 carrots, laid out in a row) Polly Darton: Oh, hi there. My name is Polly Darton, and I'd like to sing a song for you, but I can't. The song I'd like to sing's called, ""14 Carrot Love"", but as you can see, I only have (slowly counting carrots) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 carrots. Mm-hmm. (Benny Rabbit, with a carrot in his mouth, hops by behind her, and then stops to look on) How can I sing a song about 14 carrot love, when I only have 13 carrots? (she notices Benny) Benny: Uh-oh. (tries to sneak away) Polly Darton: Look! Did you see that bunny with that carrot? (Benny stops, looking skyward, his escape foiled) I wonder if he'd let me borrow it. (calls) Here bunny, bunny, bunny! Benny: (spitting out the carrot) Hey! Don't call me Bunny! The name is Benny! Polly Darton: Well, I'm sorry, Benny. I was wondering if I could borrow that carrot there. Benny: (shocked) No! No way, no chance! No how! This is my carrot, and I gotta get downtown, so goodbye! (picks up carrot in his mouth again) Polly Darton: Oh please? You have one carrot and I have 13 carrots. (Benny puts carrot back down) If I add your carrot and my 13, I'll have (slowly counting carrots) 1, 2... Benny: Yeah yeah yeah... Polly Darton: ...3, 4... Benny: Come on, I gotta get downtown!

Polly Darton: Aw, please? Don't do it for me - do it for the little children! Please? Benny: (Squeaks his teeth as he thinks about it) Oh, all right all right all right. You can borrow my carrot. But you have to give it back. And you can't, I say you can't nibble on it, okay? Polly Darton: Okay, okay. Thank you! Thank you, you - Benny: Yeah yeah yeah... Polly Darton: ...wonderful little bunny, you! Benny: (appalled) Don't call me Bunny! The name is BENNY!!! (music starts, she now sings) Polly Darton: These carrots from the garden
Are gathered as you see
In one great big bunch
As pretty as can be Benny: (unimpressed) Yeah... Polly Darton: The bunch has 13 carrots
But it only takes a shove (Benny starts getting into the beat) To add another carrot
And get 14 carrot love! 14 carrot love! (Benny starts squeaking his teeth in time to the music) 14 carrot love!
That is what we got here -
14 carrot love!
It's better than some flowers
Or candy on a ring (Benny's really getting into it) And it's all 'cause of you-ou
I have this song to sing Together: 14 carrot love!
14 carrot love!
That's what we got here -
14 carrot love! (music ends, but Benny keeps singing, leaning back on the fence) Benny: 14 carrot love! 14 carrot love! Polly Darton: (calling to him) Hey hey! Benny! Song's over, Benny! Benny: (still singing) That's what we've got here! 14 ca- (stops) Oh yeah yeah yeah, right right, well I gotta go anyway. Yeah yeah, I'm just gonna take my carrot here, and get outta here ... Polly Darton: Hey, hey you can have all those carrots, Benny. Just my way of sayin' thank you. Benny: (blown away) Oh! Oh gee, well, um ... but I don't know what to say!

Voice #2: A bark?

Voice #2: Okay, but it's awfully dark out here.

4,"Okay everybody, I'm gonna tell you about some birthday parties I've been to
And when I get to the ""Happy Birthday"" part, well,
I want you to say ""Happy Birthday"" the same way the animals said it at the party
Here we go! A cat had a birthday and all the cats came
To eat cat cake and play a cat game
To open cat presents and when they were through
They said ""Happy Birthday"" the way cats do And they said, ""Meow, meow, meow""
Everybody do it now, ""Meow, meow, meow""
Really nothing to it, ""Meow, meow, meow""
Well image that, you've just said ""Happy Birthday"" in cat
That's what you did! A duck had a birthday and all the ducks came

Really nothing to it, ""Quack, quack, quack""
Well the ducks are in luck, you've just said ""Happy Birthday"" in duck Now when a rooster wants to say ""Happy Birthday"" to you

To eat cow cake and play a cow game
To open cow presents and when they were through
They said ""Happy Birthday"" the way cows do And they said, ""Moo, moo, moo""

5,"A face can be up
A face can be down
A face can be as funny as the face of a clown A face can show just how you feel inside
When your eyes open up
And your smile opens wide Your eyes could be brown
Your eyes could be blue
But there's never ever any other face just like you When you're sad or crying
And you don't know what to do--
Somebody's face can happen along
And smile the sunshine back into you A face can show just how you feel inside
When your eyes open up
And your smile opens wide Your eyes could be brown
(Or) Your eyes could be blue
But there's never ever any other face just like you When you're sad or crying
And you don't know what to do--
Somebody's face can happen along
And smile the sunshine back into you",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Face lyrics
6,"Olivia: In the winter, springtime, and fall ...
In the summertime, I call you a friend for all seasons.
A friend, so many reasons why I like to be with you.
Just like nature, we change, too. (Here, I think David sings something, then repeats what Olivia sang) David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: My friend! David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: My friend! David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: My friend! David and Olivia: Winter, spring, summer, fall.
I wanna spend 'em all with you. Olivia: Winter is cold, the ice and the snow. David: Springtime is warm; we watch the flowers grow. Olivia: And the hot sun of summer makes us throw away our cares. David: Autumn leaves ... (maybe something about frosty air?)",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Friend For All Seasons lyrics
7,"Be kind to the river
Be good to the trees
Smile at the sunshine
And bow to the breeze
Say ""thanks for the perfume""
Of every flower you sniff
What a world
What a place
What a gift Respect the deer and buffalo
The lion and tiger too
Be kind to dogs and pussycats
And they'll be kind to you
Take care of the forest
And fish in the sea
Look after the beetle
The ant and the bee
Say ""thanks for the raindrops""
And all the clouds that drift
They're for you
They're for me
They're a gift They're for you
They're for me
They're for everyone
They're a gift",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Gift lyrics

There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole. At this point Liza takes the chair and goes off to live with her mother which is probably what Henry wanted in the first place! ** The original version has the bucket to be thatched with hay that ends up being too long and needs to be cut with a knife that ends up being too dull instead of the Sesame Street version that replaces this with plugging the hole with a stick that needs to be cut down because it is too big, but the hatchet ends up being too dull to do the work.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Hole In The Bucket lyrics

She wrote a letter to a friend in China Dear Ling Lu,
How are you?
I love my bike.
Love, Dinah The letter went out in the afternoon mail
It went by truck, it went by rail
It was a loaded on a boat on its way to China
All the way from South Carolina
When the letter got to China it was loaded on a van
And a man took the letter to Ling Lu San
Ling Lu wrote a letter back to Dinah
And sent it off to South Carolina Dear Dinah,
How are you?

A little more later on
Watching all the good things grow
That's how the world goes on

And you see all the good things growing better every day",Sesame Street,Sesame Street A Little Bit (at The Beginning) lyrics

50,"Oh what a joy
Watching life passing by and
Being a pig What could compare
To a home in a sty and
Being a pig Days are sunny and rosy
Things are comfy and cozy
With all the piggies around
What greater joy could be found Wallow awhile
In the mud that's my style
And being a pig Slurping that slop
Hey to me that's the top
And being a pig And when Mama is able
She sets a fine table
We gather around for a treat
And wow do we eat! And when the night has come creeping
In the barn we go sleeping
Who would know that pleasure gets this big!
Being a pig

Being a pig Goodnight",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Being A Pig lyrics

See what you want to see,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Go where you want to go,
Do what you want to do
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Some folks try to tell you there are things you shouldn't do
You're not strong enough or smart enough at all,
But what seems right to them quite often
Might be wrong for you,
So be sure you try to climb
Before you get too scared you fall. Oh, you can be what you want to be,
Learn what you want to learn,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Try what you need to try,
No one should question why,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself. Folks may say you're different,
That you've gone and lost your senses,
But the world is yours to walk in,
Go ahead and leap the fences. And you'll see,
Believe in yourself
And the world belongs to you and me",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Believe In Yourself lyrics

Bert: Okay, smart guy, you watch your ol' TV. I'm going to play a record anyway.

Ernie: Yeah, Bert, it's really dark.
Bert: Well, of course it's dark, Ernie. It's supposed to be dark. It's night out.
Ernie: No, Bert, I mean it's really dark. (Goes to the window.) See, the lights are all out on Sesame Street.
Bert (goes to the window): Hey, you're right, Ernie, it's really dark. I wonder why it's so dark ... Oh, I know what it is.
Ernie: Why is it so dark, Bert?
Bert: It's probably a blackout.
Ernie: Well, what's a blackout, Bert?
Bert: Well ... well, that's when the electric company has a breakdown, and then all the lights go out, 'cause you need electricity for lights. But they're probably trying to fix it, so just go to bed, Ernie. Nothing to do about it. (Goes back to bed.)
Ernie (pauses, still standing by the window): Bert ... are you scared of the dark, Bert?
Bert (sleepily): No, Ernie, I'm not scared of the dark.

Bert (irritated): Ernie ... (Sits up in bed.) Stop hitting me, Ernie! (Ernie stops.) Let me tell me you something. You can not watch television, because television needs electricity. And we don't have any electricity because of the blackout. So just go to sleep, Ernie. (Lies down.)
Ernie (starts shaking Bert after another pause): How about we listen to the radio, Bert?
Bert (sitting up): Ernie, it's the same thing with the radio! The radio needs electricity, just like the TV set. And we have no electricity because of the blackout. So just please GO TO SLEEP!

Boy, do I need it now. (Lies down. The phone rings once on the other end, and Oscar answers it. Note: Both Bert and Ernie can understand what he's saying.)

55,"Once upon a time, there lived a boy named Bert. One day Bert traded the family bicycle for a bag of magic beans.
But Bert's buddy, Ernie, looked in the bag and said, ""Beans? Blah! How boring."" And he threw the boring beans out the back window.
Immediately, the beans began to bloom. By breakfast, they had blossomed into a big, beautiful beanstalk.
When Ernie saw the beanstalk he said, ""Look. A big, beautiful beanstalk. That's really boring.""
But Bert wasn't a bit bored. ""I feel brave!"" Bert bellowed. So he bounded up the beanstalk.
Up, up, up went Bert, beyond the bean blossoms, beyond the birds, beyond the blue ... until he came to a big black building.
The building belonged to a giant named Burly Barney. Burly Barney was in the bedroom eating his breakfast of bushels of buttered buns, barrels of blueberries and bunches of bananas. When Bert saw how big Burly Barney was, Bert beat it to the back room. There, Bert found a big basket. It was full of bottlecaps.
""Boy, oh boy, oh boy!"" said Bert. ""Bottlecaps! I collect bottlecaps!"" So Bert brought the basket of bottlecaps back to the beanstalk.
But Burly Barney saw Bert, and he began to bellow. ""You took my bottlecaps!"" ""I'd better beat it,"" said Bert.
Boldly, Bert climbed down. Barney bounded down behind him. But, on a bottom branch, Bert slipped and fell with a bump.
""I'll bet you want to bash me because I borrowed your basket of bottlecaps,"" blurted Bert.
""Are you batty?"" bellowed Burly Barney. ""Those bottlecaps are boring! They were driving me bananas! Thank you for borrowing my bottlecaps!""
And Burly Barney shook Bert's hand. In fact, he shook Bert's whole body. Then Barney bounded back up the beanstalk to his beautiful black building.
And now that the basket of bottlecaps belonged to Bert, Bert had the best and biggest bunch of bottlecaps on the block. So Bert was beaming.
And everyone lived blissfully ever after. Except Ernie ... who was bored.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Bert And The Beanstalk lyrics

For once, I know he's not going to wake me up. No surprises, just peace and quiet. I'll just settle in under my blanket and go to sleep. Music starts playing Perhaps I spoke too soon! Door opens and sheep start coming in the room Sheep: Baaa, come on he's not asheep yet!
We just thought you might like to know where your blanket came from. Bert: My blanket? I know where my blanket came from! Sheep: A blanket begins in a faraway place
Where skies are blue and there's lots of space
The nights are cold and we sleep outside
To keep warm and toasty we grow hair on our hide
But when spring comes round the weather is warm
A thick woolly coat loses all of its charm
We're itchy and hot 'till the rancher arrives
To give us each a haircut and brighten up our lives
He grabs a big bag and he gathers the wool
And he stuffs and he crams 'till the bags are full
He throws 'em on the truck 'till it's piled up high
Then he climbs into the driver's seat and says ""goodbye"" That's the story of Bert's blanket
That's the story of Bert's blanket
That's the story of Bert's blanket Bert: Hey sheep! Hey sheep, aren't ya going to tell what happens next? Sheep: Oh so I suppose someone waves a magic wand and POOF!
Our wool turns into a blanket and lands on your beeeeeed Bert: Nooooo, that's not what happens to your wool. Now listen,
It goes to a mill before it lands in bed
'Cause it's gotta be twirled into long strong thread
Then it's gotta get dyed to a nice dull grey
Then woven into cloth before it's sent on its way
Get the picture? Sheep: Yes we see Bert: Well there's more
A few more touches and it goes to a store
Where it's put on a shelf, it's not long before
A warm grey blanket catches someone's eye
He says ""Hey, that's the blanket I've been longing to buy!"" Sheep: Well I'll be dagnabbed. So that's what happens! Bert: So when you climb in bed before you go to sleep
As you snuggle in your covers please think of these sheep Sheep: We'll be back on the range and doing our beeeest
To keep those blankets coming from our ranch in the weeest That's the story of Bert's blanket (repeated) Bert: Hey it's kinda late for you guys to be heading for your ranch,
There's plenty of room here if you'd like to sleep over,

And also hair and finger tips
But dearer to my heart
Is my favorite body part I love a big round nose
A nose to smell a rose
I love a nose that's cute
And sweet and small
A nose that helps you sneeze
A nose to give a little squeeze Yes, I'm fond of almost any nose at all Oh, I love a turned up nose
Just give me one of those
A nose to breathe the air
So clear and fine
To breathe and sneeze and smell
That's what a nose does well

If you had no bones at all
Then you couldn't run or crawl
And you couldn't stand up straight

Means we're thoughtless, cruel, and bad
But kids like you and me baby, we were born to add Yes, sir, we were! As we keep on wandering we see two trash cans
So we add one and make it three
There's a lot of us adders on the Jersey Shore

And a glass of cookie juice on the side
Or for a change one morning
Me will have cookies scrambled or fried It isn't hard each morning
To keep me satisfied
Just give me a soft-boiled cookie
And a glass of cookie juice on the side Sometimes I have a bowl of some crunchy cereal I'd even have some orange juice too
On other days my favorite is boiled eggs and toast
And sometimes a stack of pancakes is the breakfast I love most I'd drink a glass of milk or a cup of cocoa

Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer being red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colourful like that It's not easy being green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over
'Cause you're not standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky But green's the colour of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder
But why wonder, why wonder?
I'm green, and it'll do fine
And it's beautiful
And I think it's what I want to be",Sesame Street,Glee Cast Bein' Green lyrics

(puts binoculars back) Pay no attention, Bert.
Bert: That's very touching, Ernie, but isn't there something else you could watch maybe, huh?
Ernie: Oh, sure, Bert, I could watch birds or buses ...
Bert: Good.
Ernie: ... or TV ...
Bert: Good, why don't you? 'Cause I'm trying to read this book, see?
Ernie: Oh, because, Bert, watching my best friend is much, much better.
Bert: Uh huh, I see. (goes back to his book and tries to ignore Ernie but finally) AAAAAA! Ernie, I can't stand this! I mean, you are staring at me through those binoculars and it's driving me bananas!
Ernie: (takes his binoculars from face) Oh, oh, Bert, I didn't want to drive my old buddy bananas, I'll just put away these silly binoculars. Besides that, I don't need binoculars to watch you anyway, Bert. (starts staring at Bert, inching closer and closer until they're nose-to-nose when Bert turns around.)
Bert: (puts up with this for about 30 seconds before exploding) AAAAAA! Ernie, will you stop it?! That is no good either, I don't want you to stare at me, binoculars or not. I'm trying to read!
Ernie: Gee, Bert, you mean you're not enjoying having a friend just sort of stand here and think how marvelous you are, Bert?
Bert: Well, no, Ernie, I'm sorry but, see, when someone is staring at me all I can do is think about *them* being *there* ... staring! And I'd very much like to be able to concentrate on my book.
Ernie: Gee, I don't understand, Bert.
Bert: AAAA! I'll show you, here, take the book. (Ernie hesitates) Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it!!! (Ernie takes the book as Bert gets out of the chair)
Ernie: Okay, Bert.
Bert: Sit down, sit down. (Ernie sits) Now, now *you* try and read, go ahead. (starts staring at Ernie)
Ernie: (starts to read the pigeon book) Hmmm, okay ... Oh, gee ... (Bert looks at the camera, his eyebrows shoot up and he inches closer to Ernie as he reads. Bert's nose is now practically in Ernie's ear he's so close!) ... Wow ... (engrossed in the book and not noticing Bert at all) Hey, Bert, this is a great book, Bert. Gee, thanks for letting me read it. You know, like I said, you're the nicest, most wonderful best friend a guy ever had, Bert.

Who's a good friend of mine
He looks ferocious, but he's really fine
Go up and ask him for his autograph

He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had Now you know my buddy Frazzle
He's got fangs on his jaws
His fur is orange, and he's got these claws
He looks so mean that he could scare a crowd
But if you tickle him he laughs out loud He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had Mr. Frazzle has emotions like the rest of us do
Sometimes he feels low down and ugly, too
And then the tears begin to fill his eyes
It's so pathetic when a monster cries He goes Argh! That's how he cries
He goes Argh! That means he's sad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The lowest time that he ever had Argh! That means he's hungry
Argh! That means he's hot
Argh! That means he's sleepy

He leaves the bone and gristle and he never eats the skin.
The busboy comes and takes it, with a cough contaminates it.
Throws it in a can with coffee grounds and sardine tins.
And the truck comes by on Friday, and carts it all away.

What will we do when there's no place left to put all the garbage (garbage, garbage......) Mr. Thompson starts his Cadillac, he winds it down the freeway track,
Leaving friends and neighbors in a hydro-carbon haze.
He's joined by lots of smaller cars all sending gases to the stars.
There it forms a seething cloud where it hangs for forty days.
And the sun beats down into it,
With an ultra-violet tongue.
Turns it into smog
And then it settles in our lungs oh...

What will we do when there's nothing left to breathe
But garbage....... Getting home and taking off his shoes, he settles with the evening news,
While the kids do homework with the TV in one ear.
While Superman for the thousandth time sells talking dolls and conquers crime,
Dutilly they learn the date of birth of Paul Revere.
And there's a piece in the paper about the mayor's middle name.
He gets it read in time to watch the All-Star Bingo game oh

We're filling up our minds with garbage...... What will we do when there's nothing left to read?
And there's nothing left to need?
And there's nothing left to watch?

Me always remember just you
Goodbye, goodbye little cookie
It now time to bid you adieu Once you were baked in an oven
Just like a cake or a pie
Now you're so brown and pretty
Me hate to tell you goodbye But goodbye, goodbye little cookie
Me always remember just you
Goodbye, goodbye little cookie It now time to bid you adieu Me love your nuts and your raisins
Me love your color and smell
Me like to hold you forever
But now it is time for farewell So goodbye, goodbye little cookie

56,"When I was a little bitty boy
Just up off a floor
We used to go down to Grandma's house
Ev'ry month end or so,
We'd heva chicken pie and country ham
'N' home made butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was her great big feather bed It was nine feet tall and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On Grandma's feather bed After supper we'd sit around the fire
The old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And Granny'd sing a ballad or two
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
'Till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the mornin'
In the middle of the old feather bed It was nine feet tall and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On Grandma's feather bed Well I love my Ma, I love my Pa
I love Granny and Grandpa too
I been fishin' with my uncle
I wrassled with my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou ooo!
But if I ever had to make a choice
I guess it oughta be said
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
For Grandma's feather bed
I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road ... It was nine feet tall and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs

And the circle can join the game

No matter where I go

To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
His flickering campfires still burn Home, home on the range Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day How often at night when the heavens are bright
I see the light of those flickering stars
Have I laid there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of love Home, home on the range

Saw all the stars
Up in a ship that flies
Here is the big surprise -
I'm an Earthworm! Seen other worlds
Orange and grey
Comets were sailing by
Wonderful to the eyes
Of an Earthworm! But I did not find flowers
Houses and birds and deer
And I could not hear music
Anyplace but here So much to learn
Up in the air
Now that I have to roam
I learned that Earth is home
I'm an Earthworm! I found the circus missing
Up where the stars are clear
And I did not find kissing
Anyplace but here If there is love
Out in the stars
We'll find it, me and you
But 'til the day we do

Plays you a rock and roll tune You can see what you wanna see
Be what you wanna be
Feel what you're longing to feel
Just look in your mind
There's a place you will find
Where the things that you dream of seem real It's astonishing what you can do
With your imagination
There are so many things to go over
And under and through
So Elmo is pleased to extend you
This kind invitation
You can visit a world that is simply

Out in the cold and dark alleyway
I'm here outside
How can she be my bride
If I'm out and she's in every day? Maria: Inside
Here in my cozy room
I see my future groom
Yet I can't hold him tight
'Cause he's outside
And I'm inside this house

Their love cannot begin
Our lovers have not actually met

Cruel fate has goofed
She's in under a roof (it begins to rain)
And he's out in the rain getting wet
Rowrrrrrr Maria: Inside
My heart is nearly broken Tony: Outside
My clothes are soakin' Maria: I'm sure you'll be all right (spoken) Tony: Hey, wait a minute, I've got it! Tonight I'll go inside where my true love awaits! Why didn't I think of that before?!

It's going home and getting warm by the fire
It's true, wherever you find love it feels like Christmas A cup of kindness that we share with another
A sweet reunion with a friend or a brother
In all the places you find love it feels like Christmas It is the season of the heart
A special time of caring
The ways of love made clear
It is the season of the spirit
The message if we hear it
Is make it last all year It's in the giving of a gift to another
A pair of mittens that were made by your mother
It's all the ways that we show love that feel like Christmas A part of childhood we'll always remember
It is the summer of the soul in December

The small one has a dot
It comes at the beginning of a word like jellybeans

Jazzy music starts, numbers 1-10 flash on jazzy background.
Two hands up, fingers pop up one at a time as female voice and number above the hands count to ten.
Jazzy numbers again.
Numbered racecars pull up, voice sings 1-10.
Huge 7 is drawn on screen, voice sings ""Seven!""
Seven parts like curtains to reveal a wizard with 7 on his hat and cloak. He bows to reveal he has a 7 on his bald head as well. Then he parts his cloak to reveal another room with an identical wizard inside. Voice says ""Seven,"" slowly.
New wizard takes off his hat, gestures, and seven rabbits leap out and pile into a stack on the floor.
A turtle with a 7 on his helmet races through, running into the stack and pushing it away. Voice calls, ""Seven!""
Wizard pulls out a playing card - the 7 of clubs - he lowers it to the ground and it becomes huge and all the clubs on it turn into little black birds. Voice says, ""Seven?""
Wizard opens card like a door, revealing a red hallway. Birds flutter in, wizard closes door, which now has a large black 7 on it. Then the card sucks up into the wizard's hand.
Wizard makes a 7 appear on each side of him, then makes a flash of light towards us that fills entire screen. When light clears, we see wizard fall from sky, and pick himself up again, then we pull back as the first wizard closes his cloak again. Voice sings, ""Seven!""

Just happy to be me I went to a party just the other day
With all my friends from school and around the way
The music was playing they all jumped to their feet
But I danced to a drummer with a different kind of beat
My friends want to know why I don't move like them
I said, your dance is cool, but I dance like Kingston
I like your style, but I've got my own thing
So come on, and clap your hands and sing Be yourself, easy as ABC
Can't be no one else
Just happy to be me I was reading a book one day at home
When I heard the ring-ring of the telephone
It was a couple of friends inviting me out to play

That is the right thing to do!
Throw all your trash in the basket
And we will say 'Thank Coo' to you! (patented-Bert-laugh)

When you eat candy or gum
Throw what is left in the trashcan
Think of your small feathered chum."" (spoken) Bert: Ever see a pigeon drop a soda can on the ground? Voices: No! Bert: No. And when pigeons see breadcrumbs on the sidewalk, do they just leave them there? Voices: No! Bert: No, no, no, they pick them up with their beaks!

They can't see breadcrumbs to eat
Crackerjacks get in their feathers (awwww)

So put your trash in your pocket
If there's no basket around
Please, keep it to throw away later
Remember that bird on the ground
And ... people! background singers: Keep the park clean for the pigeons! Bert: Pigeons! pigeons cooing Bert: People! singers: Throw all your trash in the basket! Bert: Pigeons! pigeons cooing Bert: Everyone! Keep the park clean for the pigeons

All listen and hear
How whatever he touches will
Poof, disappear
Just a touch of his finger
Brings forth this reaction
He makes things go away
It's like magic subtraction One day while out riding he glanced up above
At a maid in a castle and his heart filled with love
But outside awaited the terrible fate
There were four awful dragons guarding the gate One tried to fry him and chortled with glee
But King Minus touched him and then there were three
(four take away one leaves three) Another fierce dragon leaped into view
King Minus touched him and then there were two
(three take away one leaves two) Along came another jumping high as the sun
The King took him away and then there was one
(two take away one leaves one) The last dragon thought that to hide would be best
For he saw what had happened to all of the rest
So into the forest he started to run
But King Minus found him...
...and then there were none
(one take away one leaves none) Then he rode in the castle and out on the roof
But when he touched the fair maiden
Alas, she too, went poof.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street King Minus lyrics

""I'll do it alone,"" said Lonesome Joan
And her laces stayed untied Oh, Lonesome Joan, Lonesome Joan
Felt she had to do everything alone
She said, ""I don't need no help, I can do it by myself""
Oh, Lonesome, Lonesome Joan Well, she got a little older -- thought she'd learn to read and write
Her teacher tried to help her
Joan yelled, ""Get out of my sight!""
So she never learned to write her name or even read a book
And all alone she never learned to swim or skate or count or cook Oh, Lonesome Joan, Lonesome Joan
Felt she had to do everything alone
She said, ""I don't need no help, I can do it by myself""

You don't have to do everything alone
You can use a little help

And Joan lived to the happy age of a hundred and forty four
So be sure you learned a lesson
From that old girl, Lonesome Joan

You don't have to try alone Oh, Lonesome Joan, Lonesome Joan
You don't have to do everything alone
You can use a little help
Don't have to do it by yourself

49,"Here's a little something
All of us can see each day
Now let's all take a look at it
Closer in every way
You'll see many things
That you'd never believe were there
So come and look a little closer
If you dare Although there's so many tiny little parts
That your eyes can't see
You couldn't ever hope to guess
What it's gonna turn out to be
Is it round or flat, skinny, square
Or short or tall?
Close up it doesn't look like
What it is in any way at all Did you guess what it is?
That's right!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Look A Little Closer lyrics

When I'm riding on my board catching waves into the shore with you.
I got a monster surfer dream, got to keep the water clean and blue,
So come on all around the world, let's do what surfing monsters do. Come on and love, love, love, love the ocean.
Show respect for the sea.
Be a friend to the water 'cause
It's a friend to you and me.
Help to cure it, keep it pure from sea to sea to shining sea. When I see somebody litter, it sure puts me in a bitter mood.
I say, ""Hey do what you ought to, get that trash out of the water, dude""
The birds and animals and fish have a monster surfer wish for real.
They wish that people round the world would feel how surfing monsters feel. Come on and love, love, love, love the ocean.
Show respect for the sea.
Be a friend to the water 'cause
It's a friend to you and me.
Help to cure it, keep it pure from sea to sea to shining sea. Yeah! Love, love, love, love the ocean.

74,"Muppet One:
My home's in the city on the 19th floor
You may think that's high but there's 19 more
There's lots of apartments everywhere you go
There are people on top and traffic below
You can hear buses beeping and the neighbor's TV
You can say it's noisy but it's home sweet home to me Muppet Two:
My home's in the jungle in a wooden hut
There are trees around it and wood to cut
Lots of noise to hear, the birds and monkeys shriek
And we see our mailman every other week
Now to folks other places it seems far away
You can call it jungle but it's home and where I'll stay Muppet Three:
My home is an igloo and it's made of ice
You may think it's chilly but it's paradise
We have furs and blankets there to keep us warm
We can sing and play through any winter storm
We have friends who keep saying we should move down to Nome
But we'll never do it 'cause we love our igloo home All:
A home could be a castle or a little shack
A home could be near water or a railroad track
A home can be of brick and steel or of grass you know
A home can be an igloo made of ice and snow
No matter what your house is like, whatever it may be
It always is a home sweet home for kids like you and me!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street My Home lyrics

She's my number nine cutie
She has nine hairs on her head

Tied up in ribbons of red She has nine little eyes
All the same size
Looking up, down, round, and straight ahead
She has nine little holes in her turned up nose
And she snores when she goes to bed She has nine arms that's one of her charms,
Each just like the other;
Some people say she looks like her dad;
Some say she looks like her mother. She has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 little toes on her foot.

(panting) My shadow does it too. My furry little shadow, it sleeps with me at night
I know because it's always there when I turn on the light
And when I give a skip...
Or play a little game...
Or when I hop and hop and hop
And hop and hop and hop and hop
And hop and hop and hop and hop
(panting) My shadow does the same. My furry little shadow, so faithful and so true
It follows me just everywhere, it sticks to me like glue
And if I try to duck...still there!
Or if I tell it shoo...go away! Take a hike, nice shadow.
Or if I try to run away
And run away and run away
And run away and run away
And run away and run away

A triangular home
With three sides and three corners to boot (we now see a lovely triangle-shaped house as she remembers) It was straight, it was neat
And it looked kinda sweet
Yes, you might even say it was cute (Two cowboys join her on the porch) All: My triangle home Clementine: How I miss it to bits every day
One corner to eat
One corner to sleep
And one corner to sit in and play (she walks out to a garden, where we see triangles marked on sticks being tended by more cowboys) And out in the yard
We all worked mighty hard
A'tending our triangle crop
We planted the seeds
We pulled out all the weeds
(a cowboy pulls out one marked with a rectangle and throws it over his shoulder)
And watered their small pointy tops All: My triangle home Clementine: Where the triangles grew all the day
Just climbing as high
As an elephant's eye
In their three-sided triangle way (now she's swaying behind a fence with the other cowboys, in front are cows shaped like triangles!) When it seems to be there's
Only circles and squares
Then I long for my triangle home
Where out on the range
Looking just a might strange
The triangle-doggies did roam All: My triangle home
Where the corners and sides are all free Cowboy #1: No shape is so fine Cowboy #2: As the one with three lines All: In a triangle home, yesiree
In a triangle home, yessiree

Announcer: Nancy had a pet, a nice nightingale.
Nightingale: I am a nightingale!
(Scene changes to inside the N and we find Nancy in front of a mirror putting on her napkin.)
Announcer: Now, Nancy was a nincompoop because around her neck she wore a narrow napkin!
(Switch to a close-up of a clock which pulls back to show a town hall-type building where the clock is located. A sign on the side of the road in front of the building says ""Nanny goat farm"". We see the N roll by.)
Announcer: One night in November at 9:09 she got a notion to visit a nutty Nanny Goat farm.
(The background is covered with goats and the words appear in balloons superimposed over them. The N rolls by with the nightingale being pulled behind it on a leash.)
Announcer: Numbskull! Nitwit! Nincompoop! Were some of the nasty names the other nanny goats called her as she sat nibbling on her nails.
(She's now seated on top of the N nibbling away. The N pulls to a stop next to the granny nanny goat who is seated in a chair and knitting.)
Announcer: The granny nanny goat noticed Nancy and said, ""Nancy, don't be a ninny! Never nibble on your nails!""
(We now see a letter N shaking.)
Announcer: Nancy became nervous.
(Back to Nancy on top of the N taking off her napkin and pulling a necklace out of the top of the N.)
Announcer: She took off the narrow napkin and put on a nifty necklace.
(A bird flies by with a sign reading ""noodles"" dragging behind him.)
Announcer: Instead of nibbling on her nails she started to notice noodles.
(Back to granny nanny goat who stops knitting and looks over at Nancy offscreen. We then cut to a full shot of the N as Nancy pops out of various openings and says the letter N in speech balloons. The nightingale pops out as well but he's speechless :-)

(He picks up what looks like a script in a red school binder and reads to himself as the scene changes to three chickens behind some chicken-wire. They stop pecking in the hay and look up as a number three with little silver wings flies in and hovers above their heads.)
Chicken #1: Oooh, look girls, it's the handsome number three!
Chicken #2: Hey, flying my way?!
(The number three flies away off-screen.)
Chicken #3: Toodle-oo (not sure what she says here)!
(All three chickens look at the camera and go, ""Huh?"" as the scene changes back to the studio and Cookie says ...)
Cookie Monster: Hey! Hold it, stop! Sorry, that not ""One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest"". No, that, umm .... (he checks his notes) ... let's see ... yeah, here. That ""Three Flew Over Chicken Coop"", story of handsome number three. (checks his notes again) Let's see, okay, here, here, here, here now, ""One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest"".
(Scene changes to two pigs snorting in the mud. One looks up as the sound of something flying towards them is heard off-screen.)
Pig #1: Sid?
Pig #2: Yeah, Henry?
Pig #1: Can a number four fly?
Pig #2: No, Henry.
(A number four with silver wings lands with a plop in the mud beside them.)
Pig #1: I didn't think so.
(As Cookie starts to speak, both pigs look at the camera. The scene changes back to the studio.)
Cookie Monster: Whoa! No good! Me very sorry, that not ""One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest""! That ... ummm ... let me see .... (checks his notes) .... that, yeah, here. That ""Four Flew Over Pigsty, Land In Mud"", very messy story. Now, let's try again or me get new job, oh ho! Here we go, ""One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest"". Me hope.
(Scene is a tree with one cuckoo bird in a nest.)
Cuckoo Bird: Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.
(A number one with silver wings flies swiftly overhead. The bird looks at the camera and says ...)
Cuckoo Bird: CuckOOO!
(Back to the studio.)
Cookie Monster: There you have it, ""One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest"". Finally! Very beautiful, very moving, very silly. Join me next week for ""Rocky 20"", story of ... twenty rocks, very heavy stuff. (He tosses the binder over his shoulder.) This Alistair Cookie, good evening.

Magic in the air

The world has got a glow

One Of These Things (Is Not Like The Others)
One of these things is not like the others,
One of these things just doesn't belong,
Can you tell which thing is not like the others
By the time I finish my song? Did you guess which thing was not like the others?
Did you guess which thing just doesn't belong?
If you guessed this one is not like the others,
Then you're absolutely... right! Another version: Three of these things belong together
Three of these things are kind of the same
Can you guess which one of these doesn't belong here?
Now it's time to play our game (time to play our game). Bonus Version Three of these kids belong together
Three of these kids are kind of the same
But one of these kids is doing his (her) own thing
Now it's time to play our game

A worm named Willie climbed a tree.
Upon a branch that was very high
Hung the apple of Willie's eye. (Willie crawls over, under, and around the apple.) Yo-Yo Man: And he went over the apple, under the apple, around the apple green.
""This is,"" thought Willie, ""the most delightful apple that I have ever seen!""
And he went over the apple, under the apple, around the apple, too.
""And now,"" thought Willie, licking his chops, ""I'm going to go right through!"" (Willie eats his way through the apple, which falls off the branch, leaving Willie hanging from the stem.

And this little class that I've been takin'
We make paper but not out of trees
We use old rags and dungerees
How do we do it?
You'll see First we cut 'em into pieces that are kind of small
Then we put 'em in a beater than beats 'em all
Turns 'em into pulp that is kinda like soup
Then we pour it into buckets and we stir up the goop
Sounds fun, right? Then we take a wooden frame and we dip it in the mix
And we shake out the water, that's how we get our kicks
Then we open up the frame and slap it on the tray
First I had a little trouble, but, it turned out okay
Not as easy as it looks Then we stack it in a press
And we tighten the screws
This flattens the paper
And the water gets excused
We open up the press
Take our paper off the pile
And we stick it on the window (sounds like ""winda"")
And we leave it there a while
Paper's dryin' now
The pink one's mine We take our paper off the window once it's good and dry
This takes a little doing
Oh, and by the by
See the different colors
Reds, yellows and greens?
Remember these were rags once
And old blue jeans
Really kind of amazin' Well, now our paper makin' day is done
Hope you liked it, we had fun
If you ever get the chance
You should give it a try
But now we gotta go

All the things I've done and how it's been,
And I can't help believin' in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end.
I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures had myself some friends
Spent a time or two in my own home. I have to say it now it's been good life all in all,
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around.
And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,
While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass a pipe around
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in, how sweet it is to love someone,
How right it is to care, how long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow and what about our dreams
And all the memories we share. Days they pass so quickly now, the nights are seldom long
Time around me whispers when it's cold.
The changes somehow frightens me, still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old.
It's tho' my life's been good to me there's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a fam'ly I'd like to sail away
Dance across the mountains on the moon. I have to say it now it's been good life all in all,
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around.
And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,
While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass a pipe around

And not lose the ball in the sun
And then I'd awake from this long reverie
And pray that the ball never came out to me

Make my way to the tubby

And I'm lucky that you're mine
Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fond of you. (repeat chorus)

Simple Simon: Something is wrong, somewhere.
Duck: (jumping up, trying to fly) Quack-quack-QUACK, quack-quack, quack-quack, quack-QUACK. (angrily) Something IS wrong. I can't fly.
Sheep: Baaaah! Something is wrong. (spinning around) I walk funny.

Duck: Quack-quack-quack-quack-quack-quack.
Sheep: Pardon me, bu-u-ut I think you have my legs.

Snake: (having slithered into the background, sadly) It was too good to last.
Sheep: Baah. Something is still wrong.
Duck: Quack-quack-quack-quack. We've got the wrong legs!

What kind of worm he'll be.
I bet the little fellow'll be a lot like me. Jim.

He will follow me wherever I go, 'cause I'm his flesh and blood
And he'll do whatever I do,
And he won't be afraid of mud!
Yes he won't be afraid of that ooshy, gooshy mud. Someday he'll grow up, and be something...
Maybe he'll grow up to be a worm that lives in an apple tree
Or wear a taxi driver's hat, and drive a cab -- imagine that!
Or be a space-worm in the skies -- I hope they have a rocket his size
Or he'll dive from a high, high tower, after he learns to swim

That wouldn't be too hard for Jim
Not him! Him? But supposing he's a Her?

That's it -- Bea!

She will stand up tall with her head in the air
And her tail down on the ground
And she won't let any robin push her around!
No she won't let some bob-bobbin' robin push her around. And when she grows up, hey,
She could be an astronaut too,
She could do all the stuff that Jim could do
Dig any hole and climb any tree, and be as worm as a worm can be
She'll stand up to any butterfly, in the city or the park
And she'll dig underground with her chin up high,
And she won't be afraid of the dark

On his birthday number nine
Which isn't bad--in fact, it's fine
Except he asked nine swine to come at (?) for birthday cake and wine. Except his mom, Sweet Adeline
Who went to work at nine past nine
Just hated swine to drink her wine

So--he simply didn't tell her At nine past nine, the pigs and swine broke down the door
And gobbled cake and oinked nine grunts
And pulled nine kinds of dirty stunts! (The pigs throw dishes around, dance on the table, and draw pictures on the wall.) The house looked like a stinking sty,
And Bumble Artie had to cry
When all nine swine cried, ""Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
May Bumble live nine hundred years!"" Which isn't bad.

Except, just then, Sweet Adeline,
Who finished work at (half?) past nine
And hurried home so she could dine
With Bumble on his birthday nine
And found, instead, nine squealing swine,
Began to shriek and shake and whine: ""I'll give you pigs 'til number nine to split!
Get lost! Vamoose! Just scram, or else I'll slice you into ham!"" (She holds up nine fingers, one at a time. As she hold up each one, a pig rushes out and slams the door.) Nine times the door slammed. (Door slams once more.) Then again.
""How odd,"" thought Adeline; ""it's ten.""

Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are

Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig? A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish? A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

And I was tall enough - yes I was tall enough
I could stretch and reach the light switch in the hall enough
And I must have turned it on and off a hundred times a day 'cause I was
Tall enough

That everyone could reach except myself
I would stand up on my tip toes but I wouldn't quite reach the sack

Everybody spies while he's counting
Oh they glow and smile 'cause his coconut pile
Is growing big as a mountain
Sure as stars are bright, and water's deep

I'm going to tell you about the first day I went to school.] (Creepy organ music begins) The first day that I went to school yes, I remember clearly
My mummy made me leave at home the spiders I loved dearly
I felt a little sad as I walked through the classroom door,
But then I saw more children than I'd ever seen before.
""Ah ha!"" I cried, ""this new school will be fun
For I can count all of the children one by one"" Yes, I'll count Gregory and Sue, that makes number 1 and 2
I'll count Boris and Igor that makes number 3 and 4
Maurice, Jane and Eloise, 5, 6, 7 if you please
Theodore and Adeline make number 8 and number 9
And then, I will count Ben,
For Ben is number 10 Yes, there's Gregory, Sue, and Boris
Igor, Eloise, and Maurice
Theodore, Jane and Adeline and Ben
And that makes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The teacher taught the alphabet, we had to learn each letter
The alphabet was not much fun, but then things got much better
The teacher said ""My children dear, it's time for numbers now
Can anybody count to ten?""
A small voice cried ""And how!""
""Just watch"" I cried, ""before this class is done,
I will count all of the children one by one"" Yes, I'll count Gregory and Sue, that makes number 1 and 2
I'll count Boris and Igor that makes number 3 and 4

And that makes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Yes, ha ha!
But those are only just some of the children in the class.
Next I must count the rest of the children.
Then I must count the children in the all the other classes in the school.

I know a place on which you can depend
A place that's quiet and always near by
And you know there No one's a stranger, the door's open wide
And what good things you'll find waiting inside
The smiles, the kindness, all troubles behind
When you go there You're on the happiest street in the world
The happiest street in the beautiful world

For you and for me Yes it's the happiest street in the world

32,"Once there lived a little monster
In a kingdom far away.
And a very strange thing happened
As he brushed his teeth one day. As he squeezed his tube of toothpaste,
Deepest thunder shook the skies.
And suddenly a genie stood
Before his very eyes. ""I'm the genie of the toothpaste,""
Said the genie with a laugh.
""I've been trapped inside that toothpaste tube
For 3 weeks and a half.
You squeezed the tube and set me free
So here is what I'll do -
I'll let you have 3 wishes
And I'll make them all come true."" ""Oh boy!"" exclaimed the monster,
""Wow! 3 wishes just for me!
Now let me think and then decide
What my first wish will be."" Now my favorite thing is cookies,
Thought the monster with a grin.
But first I'll wish for something nice
To keep my cookies in.
I would like a million cookies,
But before I use that wish ... ""Hey, Genie,"" said the monster,
""Will you please bring me a dish?"" ""Will I ever!"" said the genie,
""For your wish is my command.""
And instantly a dish appeared
Right in the monster's hand. ""Hey, I did it!"" cried the genie.
""Wow! I haven't lost my touch!""
""It's a nice dish,"" said the monster,
""But it won't hold very much."" The monster thought of all the cookies
That he'd soon get with his wish.
And he knew a million cookies
Couldn't fit on one small dish. He would need something much bigger.
So the monster said, ""Hey, Genie!
I would like a great big box ...
This plate is much too teeny!"" ""You want a box? You've got it,""
Said the genie with a smirk.
And instantly a box appeared.
The monster cried, ""Nice work!"" But although the box was pretty big
And could hold lots of stuff -
Could it hold a million cookies ...?
It just wasn't big enough. So the monster called the genie
And said, ""Boy, am I in luck!
Since you'll give me what I wish for ...
How about a great big truck?"" And right away a truck appeared
Before the monster's eyes.
""Fantastic!"" cried the monster.
""It is just the perfect size!"" ""It will hold a million cookies,
And I'll never have to worry.
And that is what I wish for!
Give me cookies now! Please hurry!"" ""I am sorry,"" said the genie,
""For though cookies are delicious,
I cannot give them to you
'Cause you've used up your 3 wishes."" (love that rhyme!) ""Oh, no!"" exclaimed the monster.
""is it true? I just can't tell.
For although I'm good at eating things,
I do not count so well."" ""Let us count these things together,""
Said the genie, ""and you'll see -
The dish is 1, the box is 2,
And then the truck makes 3.""
""3 things! You're right,"" the monster said,
""Now what am I to do?
I've used up my 3 wishes
And I'm very hungry, too!"" ""Gee, that's too bad,"" the genie said,
""But now my job's complete.""
""I'm so hungry,"" said the monster,
""Oh, I need something to eat!"" ""I'm sad your wish for cookies
Can't come true,"" the genie said.
""That's okay,"" replied the monster ...
"" ... I'll just eat the truck instead!"" And as the monster ate the truck,
The genie disappeared,
Saying, ""I have seen a lot of things -
But boy ... is that guy weird!""",Sesame Street,Sesame Street The Monster's Three Wishes lyrics

Once upon a time, there were nine naughty noodles.
Oscar: Nine naughty noodles?
Big Bird: Sure. Now these nine naughty noodles lived in a nest.
And their names were Ned, Nat, Norman, Nathaniel, Nelly, Nan, Nancy, Norma, and Naomi.
Oscar: Oh no.
Big Bird: Now one day, Nora moved into the neighborhood.
Oscar: Nora? Another noodle I suppose.
Big Bird: (laughs) No. Nora was a nectarine.
Oscar: Naturally.
Big Bird: For Nora, the noodles learned not to be naughty but nice.
Oscar: Doesn't this story ever come to an end?
Big Bird: Ah, you want this story to come to an end?
Oscar: I sure do.

38,"O-O-O-O-O-O-O-Oooo..
Grow and go
Roll over the road
Where the goat explodes all the Os
And the crow flies low
Past the croaking toad
And the boat floats over the ocean
But the wind did blow
And it started to snow
So the toad went home
To the telephone
He spoke to the goat
Who was eating a bowl of bones, potatoes and soap (o-o-o-o-o-o)
A rope did float
And hook the goat
And a boy climbed the stone made of Os
The Os turned to smoke
And started to float
Closer to the bulldozer
Who closed up the hole
So the cold wind could not blow
And the sun did show
So the roses could grow
And the whole world would know
That the boat, bulldozer, toad, and the crow
And the boy and the rope, riding the goat
Were all OK (o-o-o-o)
OK?

The ball leaves the pyramid from the top, as the eye lifts again, and now rolls and bumps off two thingys that look like the top of Russian buildings, where it is kicked by a Russian dancer We see a Swiss-like mountain climber standing atop a tiny mountain with a long horn in his mouth, he swings to the right in time to collect the ball in his horn, we flash to the number 7 again as the voice says ""Seven!"" then the climber swings to the left as he blows the ball loose The ball lands on a bull in a ring, bounces off him and hits a matador holding out a red cape, causing the matador to swing wildly thus sending the ball off to... A windmill with its sails turning, a hole in its base which the ball attempts to go through but it bounces off one of the sails... Now it knocks over a flat policeman character and rolls into a sentry box which makes two guards pop out of their holes on either side of the box (the guards are dressed like the ones you see in front of Buckingham Palace). We again see the number 7 as the voice says ""Seven!"" Now the ball lands on the same roller-coaster slide we saw in the beginning, bounces off a couple of thingys that light-up, rolls down a ramp which leads to a big production number graphic. As the numbers appear in the middle of this structure, we see shooting-gallery type ducks drifting by on a lake in the upper right corner, a sun above them, a city-scape at night with floodlights lighting the sky in the upper left corner, a night sky with stars and a planet (looks like Saturn with a ring) in the lower-right corner and a daytime sky with clouds in the lower left corner.

And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions,
And rainbows have nothing to hide.
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see.
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me. Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it,
And look what it's done so far.
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing?
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me. All of us under its spell,
We know that it's probably magic.... Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name.
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same.
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
Is it something that I'm supposed to be?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me.

Once upon a time, there was a queen who hated the letter ""T"".
Queen: I've never liked the horrid ""tuh-tuh"" sound. So I hereby rule that nothing beginning with the letter ""T"" will ever allowed in my kingdom.
Herbert Birdsfoot: So the people of the land tore down the towns and their towers, tossing out their trumpets and toys. And pretty soon, there wasn't anything in the kingdom that began with ""T"". Or so they thought, for one day, along came...
Tom: Me. Tom Tattertall Tuttletut. And I've got a truckful of turtles, tea, tuna, toads, teddy bears, and trash.
Queen: What did you say?
Man: Hi, your majesty. Do you want to buy a tuba or a ton of tomatoes?
Queen: Throw this man into the dungeon!
Tom: But why?
Queen: Because those are all ""T"" words. And nothing starting with ""T"" is allowed in my kingdom.
Tom: Untrue! There's lots of things beginning with ""T"" around here.
Queen: Like what?
Tom: Well, for one thing, there's the king over there.
Queen: What about him?
Tom: He's wearing trousers, and that's a terrific ""T"" word.

K, key: Another one I haven't seen in ages. Typewriter tries to open a door and finds it locked. He unlocks it with a key. When opened, door reveals two fierce eyes in the dark and maybe some roaring and growling. Typewriter leaves quick, but I hope he locked the door first!
L, lion: Typewriter hears a lion roaring offscreen and is really scared but types, ""l, lion."" Lion roars some more and enters. It's tiny and typewriter giggles, but it roars again and scares typewriter away.
M, magic: Typewriter makes (I think) a rabbit appear and vanish. He does the same trick with a scorpion-like creature. Then he makes himself disappear, but we can still hear him giggling!
N, nose: Typewriter is with a gigantic nose and mouth looking very like one from the ear skit. Nose starts to sneeze twice, but typewriter puts a finger below it and stops the sneeze. Then nose sneezes a sneeze that blows typewriter away.
O, owl: Not sure here ... I think the typewriter must be having some trouble, because I remember a bunch of crumpled paper. An owl lands on him.
P, pencil: Nothing appears when typewriter types. So he writes, ""p, pencil"" with a pencil. I think he sharpens it with some part of him. Then he sticks it in his wheel, which goes flat.
Q, quiet: Unheard laughers won't shut up until typewriter repeatedly yells, ""QUIET!""
R, rope: Jump-rope drops from sky. Typewriter jumps with it until he jumps up off the screen!
S, spring: Yet again, nothing appears when typewriter types. A spring pops out of him and keeps springing away from him. Typewriter chases it, jumping like a spring.
T, train: An electric train runs around typewriter, who makes train-whistle sounds.
U, umbrella: It starts to rain, so the typewriter opens an umbrella over himself. When the rain stops, he closes umbrella and gets stuck in it! After a brief struggle, he gets his wheels out and rolls away, singing his customary, ""Nooney, nooney, nooney, noo...""
V, vacuum: The typewriter keeps rolling paper up, but a vacuum cleaner keeps sucking up the paper. Typewriter finally types, ""v, vacuum."" Then the vacuum sucks up the whole typewriter.
W, wall: Typewriter rushes in, crashing into an invisible wall. He smashes his way through.
X, x-ray: Something seems to be wrong with one of the typewriter's wheels. He examines it with an x-ray, appears to find problem, and oils wheel. It now rolls fine.
Y, yo-yo: Typewriter is playing with a yo-yo, the end of which gets stuck offscreen. Typewriter tries to get it free, but ends up pulling himself offscreen.
Z, zoo: Typewriter comes to a cage and is scared by the roaring of a lion. He hears a bird sound and sees bird come up to bars of cage. Bird honks like a car and scares him away.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street The Typewriter Guy lyrics

And lazy days in summer

With no place much to go

Used my favorite chair

Oh my trusty rusty telescope is going to get even rustier. There, there, we made it. Okay, walk up on to the river bank. Here, oh look over there. It's a bunch of elephants. We'd better tiptoe past them. Are you tiptoeing with me? Good! There, okay now we're past the elephants. We should be near the tiger's house. Let's climb that tree so we can look around. You climbing with me? Okay. Here we go. All right, now here we are high in the tree. Let's look through my trusty rusty telescope and try to find that tiger. Look to the right. Look to the left. Look down ... hmmm ... I don't see a tiger.
Mr. Tiger: Good afternoon!
Ernie: Oops. There's a big furry striped animal in this tree with us.
Mr. Tiger: Roar!
Ernie: It's a tiger! RUN! Climb down the tree as fast as you can. He's following us - Run! Tiptoe past the elephants. Run down the river bank. Swim the jungle river. Climb up and cross through the thicket of thorns. Then slap the mosquitoes away. And run through the jungle. Now jump over the fence. Now run up the hill. Now run down the hill. Now open the door and (sound of door closing) ooh ... ahh ... we made it ... we're home ...

All hung with lights for Christmas

I know because I've seen
Once a year the place I walk is filled with trees of green
And pine cone smells of Christmas
Floating thru the air
To jingle bells of Christmas
And if that isn't a true blue miracle
I don't know what one is But the greatest wonder of them all
Is not what's happening around you, it's the way
You start to be
Yes the greatest wonder of them all is how your
Heart is filled with love
You start to light up like a Christmas tree Feelings feel so wonderful
You have to let them show
Maybe that's why ev'ryone begins to get a glow
And fill their hearts with Christmas

Beyond the twelfth sea
On the twelfth mountain
And near the twelfth stream
In castle number twelve
With twelve towers
Lived a beautiful princess named Twelveia At noon, on the twelfth day of the twelfth month
Twelveia would be twelve years old!
So she sent her twelve knights
To twelve kingdoms
To invite twelve princes
And twelve princesses
To her birthday party! Twelve cannons fired twelve shots
Announcing Twelveia's twelfth birthday
Twelve chariots each drawn by twelve horses
Arrived with twelve princes and twelve princesses
Each carrying twelve gifts for Twelveia Twelve courses were cooked by twelve cooks
Wearing twelve hats
Mixing with twelve spoons One cake was baked by twelve bakers
Twelveia cried twelve tears
Because she was disappointed
That there was only one cake
Until she climbed twelve steps
To the twelfth tower and saw ...
That the cake was a huge number 12!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street Twelveia lyrics

Waitress: What was the question?
Cookie Monster: Me want to know why town is called Twin Beaks.

Put a V in the ground
And up grew a vine
With V-words all around She stepped on ""vest""

Was a railroad station
So she got on the train
And took a vacation",Sesame Street,Sesame Street V - Vine lyrics

Very, very, very, very
Glad to see you
I'm here to sing about a very, very,

Very, very, very, very,
Very many words that start with ""V"" (spoken)
Now let me think. Hmmmm. A-ha! I thought of some. (sung)
There's ""vegetables."" That's a ""V"" word.

(Crystal ball shows the letters of the alphabet in rapid succession until it gets to W. Scene changes to show a sign marked ""Washington."" A nearby sign marked ""west"" is pointing in that direction.)
Announcer: Wanda the witch lived somewhere west of Washington.
(Scene changes to show Wanda, an old witch who wears a long black dress and pointed black hat.)
Announcer: Around her waist, instead of a belt, she wore a worm.
(We see a close-up of the worm wiggling around Wanda's waist.)
Announcer: Wanda had a pet weasel.
(Scene changes to show a weasel wearing a collar.)
Weasel: I am a weasel.
Announcer: And on her head, a wiry wig.
(We see a close-up of Wanda's wig, which is made of W's. Scene changes to a calendar and focuses on the word ""Wednesday"" on it. Scene then changes to show Wanda walking through a snowy scene.)
Announcer: On Wednesday, in the middle of winter, Wanda walked to the well to get water to wash her wig.
(A snowman holds up a sign that says ""Winter. Then Wanda arrives at the well and tugs at the rope attached its wheel -- without success. We see the word ""wheel"" during the announcer's next speech.)
Announcer: But the wheel on the well was worn, and Wanda grew weary. So she waved her wand, and her washtub filled with warm water.
(Wanda waves her wand, and we see the word ""wand."" A washtub appears before her. A small cloud appears above the washtub, filling it with rain.)
Announcer: But just as Wanda was about to drop her wig into the warm water, a wild wind whipped the wig from her hand and blew it away forever.
(A windstorm marked ""Wind"" blows Wanda's wig from her hand and out of sight.)
Announcer: Which taught Wanda this lesson: witches who wash their wigs on windy winter Wednesdays are wacky.
(Scene changes to show some bald witches dancing around a washtub filled with wigs made of W's. One of the witches cackles wildly. Scene changes to crystal ball, still showing a W.)

If it grows too big for the clothes it wears
Then you'll know as you watch it and you see it grow
It's alive
If it's splashing water or it's breathing air
If it roars like a tiger or it eats like a bear
That'll show you all you need to know that it's alive Eatin' a sandwich or eatin' a shoe
Snackin' on apples or left over stew
If it's breathing or growing or eatin' some lunch

What is friend?
And me think,
Friend something better than chocolate ice cream! A friend somebody to take to park,
A buddy you can buddy with 'til it start getting dark,
To laugh and joke and hippity-hop it,
Or tickle and poke 'til friend tell you to stop it,
And me no think of any more.
Well maybe friend somebody

49,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how Jim Henson used to make me smile
And I knew if he had his turn
That he could make those people learn
Knowing they'd be quiet with a smile
The shocking news made me quiver
My mom broke it to me over dinner
I thought of my Kermit
Not wanting to believe this was it
I can't remember if I cried
When I heard the legend died
But something touched me deep inside
The day the Muppets cried So, why, why must I say goodbye
Kermit's eyes were heavy
As Miss Piggy cried
I'll miss the good ol' days with cookies scrambled or fried
Singin' that's the day a part of me died
That's the day a part of me died Did Bert and Ernie teach you of love?
Can you take a bath alone in the tub
If your mommy tells you so?
I can button up my shirt
Use a spoon to eat dessert
Even reach books way high on the shelf
Well, you should see me pour a glass of juice
Wiggle my front tooth that's loose
You should see me tie my shoes
Man, hear me add up one and two
I can recite my alphabet
There's not a letter I'll forget
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the Muppets cried
I started singin' So, why, why must I say goodbye
Kermit's eyes were heavy
As Miss Piggy cried
I'll miss the good ol' days with cookies scrambled or fried
Singin' that's the day a part of me died
That's the day a part of me died Oscar has his things all tattered and worn
Full of holes and mostly torn
That's the only way it should be
Oscar has a newspaper 13 months old
A wrapped fish in it, all smelly and cold
From garbage that came from you and me
1.........2...........3...........4............5.......
6..........7..........8...........9.............10...
You can't forget 11 and 12
The ladybugs they played well
If they broke their jump rope
Instead they'd tell knock knock jokes
At their picnic in the park
The day the Muppets cried
We were singin' So, why, why must I say goodbye
Kermit's eyes were heavy
As Miss Piggy cried
I'll miss the good ol' days with cookies scrambled or fried
Singin' that's the day a part of me died
That's the day a part of me died Cookie Monster was really no monster
He just thought the moon was a cookie impostor
A glass of cookie juice on the side
I'll always prefer soft boiled cookies and pie
I love my cookies scrambled or fried
C is for cookie and that's good enough for me
Kermit could make Miss Piggy swoon
While Big Bird and Snuffleupagus sang their tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
I would've never known which one was not like the other
Was it the guy with the yellow hood?
I sang along every chance I could
The day the Muppets cried
We started singin' So, why, why must I say goodbye
Kermit's eyes were heavy
As Miss Piggy cried
I'll miss the good ol' days with cookies scrambled or fried
Singin' that's the day a part of me died
That's the day a part of me died So there we were all in one tub
Singin' rubber ducky you're the one
He made bath time so much fun
So, come on ducky be yellow, ducky be chubby
He always made his way into the tubby
Rubber ducky I'm awfully fond of you
You should see me brush my hair
Even pick out the clothes I wear
It's no problem you see
Just thank Grover, he taught me
And as my Mom tucked me in goodnight
I turned on my Elmo night light
I knew something was missing alright
The day the Muppets cried
I was singin' So, why, why must I say goodbye
Kermit's eyes were heavy
As Miss Piggy cried
I'll miss the good ol' days with cookies scrambled or fried
Singin' that's the day a part of me died
That's the day a part of me died I'm waiting for a sunny day
To lift me up and wipe my tears away
Was Sesame Street going to be O.K.?
I turned on my TV some more
Where I'd learned so many years before
But the man said the Muppets couldn't come out and play
And in the streets the children screamed
But I sat and lived his dreams
As long as I live his words are spoken
His world was always open
A part of me I'll miss the most
The Count, Kermit and cookies on toast
His living became a legend
The day the Muppets cried So, why, why must I say goodbye

66,"Tanya Tucker: You'll never take the Texas out of me
I guess a homesick country girl is all I'll ever be
And though destiny directs us
You can take me out of Texas
But you'll never take the Texas out of me I feel at home in Oklahoma
I'm at ease in Tennessee
But my roots are deep in Texas
Home is always in the heart of me You'll never take the Texas out of me
I guess a homesick country girl is all I'll ever be
And though destiny directs us
You can take me out of Texas
But you'll never take the Texas out of me Big Bird (spoken): You know, Tanya, I feel the same way about my home sweet home (sung) You can't take Sesame Street out of me
And if I went to Texas I'd take Sesame with me
And though I like other places
I'd miss familiar faces
So you can't take Sesame Street out of me TT and BB: Our home sweet homes are very different
But we love them just the same
And when we take our memories with us
Home is sweet by any other name BB: You can't take Sesame Street out of me TT: Never take the Texas out of me BB: That funny homesick feeling is the same for you and me Both: And if we were to trade places
It would take more than erasers
'Cause you'll never take the feeling out of me TT: You'll never take the Texas BB: Sesame Street! TT: Out of me",Sesame Street,Sesame Street You'll Never Take the Texas Out of Me lyrics
67,"There's my mom and me
And my brother makes three
And as far as I see
We're a family (yup) a family
I love her and she
Says she really loves me
That's the way it should be
In a family (yup) a family
Each home may be different
But I don't ask why
'Cause love is all I need to get by
So if you're like me
Love somebody and see
How it works perfectly 1, 2, 3
You're a family Sometimes you can live only with your mom
Or sometimes just with your dad
Or you could live with your grandma or grandpa
Or sometimes with your aunt and uncle
I even know a girl who lives with her aunt alone
But they're all family just like mine
And that's the truth Each home may be different
But I don't ask why
'Cause love is all I need to get by
So if you're like me
Love somebody and see
How it works perfectly 1, 2, 3
You're a family (yup!)",Sesame Street,Sesame Street You're A Family lyrics

69,"Broken and beautiful, fractured and rare
Missing pieces that used to be there.
Busted and heavenly, trash from afar
To me you look complete, hey, who needs hands and feet?
When you're beautiful, beautiful,
Just as you are. Busted and heavenly, of trash, you're the star
Your arms have gone astray,
Your nose is far away,
And you're beautiful, beautiful,
Just as you are.",Sesame Street,Sesame Street You're Beautiful (Just As You Are) lyrics

Somewhere in the sky
Bright and proud, way up high.
You're gonna be a star
Somewhere in the blue
There's a spot just for you! At night when the sky is clearing
You'll talk with the other stars
I bet you'll be overhearing
What Jupiter said to Mars! A shiny little star
Is what you're gonna be--
Just you wait and see!",Sesame Street,Sesame Street You're Gonna Be A Star lyrics

You've got baby wiles
You always wear those pretty baby styles

Who's that walkin' 'round here?
Mercy!
Sounds like baby patter!
Baby elephant patter, that's what I calls it! (sung)
Say, up in Harlem
At a table for two
There were four of us
Me, your big feet and you!
From your ankles up, I say you sure are sweet
From there down, there's just too much feet!
Yas! Your feet's too big!
Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big!
Can't use ya 'cause your feet's too big!
I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big!
Yeah! Da-dee-do-dah, wan-ga-der!
Where'd you get 'em?
Nyah-da-dum!
Your girl, she likes you, she thinks you're nice
Got what it takes to be in paradise
She says she likes your face, she likes your rig
But, man, oh, man, them things are too big! Oh, your feet's too big!
Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big!
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big!
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big! (spoken)
My goodness, those are gunboats!
Shift! Shift! Shift! Oh, your pedal extremities are colossal!
To me you look just like a fossil!
You got me walkin', talkin' and squawkin'
'Cause your feet's too big, yeah! (spoken)
Come on and walk that thing!
Oh, I never heard of such walkin'! Mercy!

And it's bound to be a new sensation
Before very long
It will rage across the nation
Hold on to your seat
I'm warning you in advance
'Cause it's the zany, zesty, zippy, zingy, Zig Zag Dance It goes:
Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z
Zig Zag
It goes:
Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z

74,"Well I've seen a lot of letters and it seems to me
There's something real special 'bout the letter ""Z""
But boy we're sick of singing 'bout zippers and zoos
There ain't enough ""Z"" words
Got the ZZ Blues You can stick with ""zebra"" 'cause it's tried and true
Maybe mention ""zither"" just for something new
But once you've shown them ""zebra"", ""zither"", ""zippers"" and ""zoos""
You're almost out of ""Z"" words
Got the ZZ Blues Time to write a song about Zanzibar
C'mon and sing along about Zanibar
Guess I could be wrong about Zanzibar
Going zingy with the ZZ Blues We're zooming back to zipper 'cause it's still the best
Zipping back to zebra and we need a rest
Gettin' tired of thinking
Yeah we've paid our dues
There ain't enough Z words
Got the ZZ Blues (band starts falling asleep while still rocking!) Only band I ever worked with to fall asleep and keep playing the blues!
Guess I might as well join 'em
and cop some Zs myself! (ends with band asleep but the music still going!)",Sesame Street,Sesame Street ZZ Blues lyrics
